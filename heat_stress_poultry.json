    "abstract": "High ambient temperature has emerged as a major constraint for the future development of the poultry industry, especially in the tropics and subtropics. The scarcity of resources coupled with harsh environmental conditions is the most crucial predicaments in the way to rationalize optimum production of broiler. Heat stress disturbs the physiological biochemistry of the broiler which ultimately reduces feed intake and feed efficiency which ultimately results in reduced performance and productivity. Under hot environmental conditions, feed utilization is disturbed by the deposition of fat and oxidative stress. In addition, changes in blood cells, acid-base balance, immune response, liver health, and antioxidant status are some of the major dynamics altered by heat stress. The broilers have a narrow range of temperatures to withstand heat stress. In this review, we have discussed the various physicochemical changes during heat stress, their possible mechanisms, and mitigation strategies to reduce heat stress.",

    "title": "Protein and Amino Acid Metabolism in Poultry during and after Heat Stress: A Review.",
    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "This review examined the influence of environmental heat stress, a concern facing modern broiler producers, on protein metabolism and broiler performance, as well as the physiological mechanisms that activate and control or minimize the detrimental impacts of stress. In addition, available scientific papers that focused on amino acids (AA) digestibility under stress conditions were analyzed. Furthermore, AA supplementation, a good strategy to enhance broiler thermotolerance, amelioration, or stress control, by keeping stress at optimal levels rather than its elimination, plays an important role in the success of poultry breeding. Poultry maintain homeothermy, and their response to heat stress is mainly due to elevated ambient temperature and the failure of effective heat loss, which causes a considerable negative economic impact on the poultry industry worldwide. Reduced feed intake, typically observed during heat stress, was the primary driver for meat production loss. However, accumulating evidence indicates that heat stress influences poultry metabolism and endocrine profiles independently of reduced feed intake. In conclusion, high ambient temperatures significantly reduced dietary AA intake, which in turn reduced protein deposition and growth in broilers. Further studies are required to determine the quantity of the AA needed in warm and hot climates and to introduce genetic tools for animal breeding associated with the heat stress in chickens.",

    "title": "Impact of Heat Stress on Poultry Health and Performances, and Potential Mitigation Strategies.",
    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Heat stress is one of the major environmental stressors in the poultry industry resulting in substantial economic loss. Heat stress causes several physiological changes, such as oxidative stress, acid-base imbalance, and suppressed immunocompetence, which leads to increased mortality and reduced feed efficiency, body weight, feed intake, and egg production, and also affects meat and egg quality. Several strategies, with a variable degree of effectiveness, have been implemented to attenuate heat stress in poultry. Nutritional strategies, such as restricting the feed, wet or dual feeding, adding fat in diets, supplementing vitamins, minerals, osmolytes, and phytochemicals, have been widely studied and found to reduce the deleterious effects of heat stress. Furthermore, the use of naked neck (Na) and frizzle (F) genes in certain breed lines have also gained massive attention in recent times. However, only a few of these strategies have been widely used in the poultry industry. Therefore, developing heat-tolerant breed lines along with proper management and nutritional approach needs to be considered for solving this problem. Thus, this review highlights the scientific evidence regarding the effects of heat stress on poultry health and performances, and potential mitigation strategies against heat stress in broiler chickens and laying hens.",

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "This review focuses on the osmoregulatory function of betaine and its effect in terms of alleviating heat stress in poultry. Poultry appear to be particularly sensitive to temperature-associated environmental challenges, especially heat stress. High ambient temperatures are deleterious to productive performance in poultry, including broilers, laying hens, quails and turkeys, resulting in considerable economic losses. Heat stress impairs overall poultry production by decreasing feed intake and negatively affecting intestinal development, leading to reduced nutrient digestibility. Apart from inducing a high mortality rate, heat stress is known to depress growth rate and reduce meat yield in broilers. In layers, lower feed intake impairs ovarian function, leading to decreased feed efficiency, egg production and egg quality. In addition, reduced immune functions, such as thyroid activity and antibody production, are evident in poultry exposed to heat stress. Heat stress increases the production of oxidants, causing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation of cell membranes. Poultry respond physiologically and behaviourally when encountering the negative effects of heat stress, attempting to return the body to homeostasis. This requires energy at the expense of weight gain or egg production. Due to its zwitterionic structure, betaine has osmoprotective properties that aid in protecting intestinal cell proteins and enzymes from environmental stress, including high ambient temperature, thereby counteracting performance losses. Betaine also exerts an osmoregulatory role in cells, regulating water balance, and this results in more stable tissue metabolism. Inclusion of betaine in the diet may be beneficial for alleviating physical reactions to heat stress, as indicated by increases in nutrient digestibility. In broilers, betaine supplementation increases weight gain and breast muscle yield, while improving feed conversion. In layers, betaine supplementation improves egg production, egg quality traits and immune indices. In conclusion, due to its osmoregulatory functions, betaine plays an important role in alleviating heat stress in poultry.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Heat stress can affect the production of poultry through complex interactions between genes, metabolites and microorganisms. At present, it is unclear how heat stress affects genetic, metabolic and microbial changes in poultry, as well as the complex interactions between them. Thus, at 28  days of age a total of 200 Arbor Acres broilers with similar body weights were randomly divided into the control (CON) and heat stress treatment (HS). There were 5 replicates in CON and HS, respectively, 20 per replication. From the 28-42  days, the HS was kept at 31 ± 1°C (9:00-17:00, 8 h) and other time was maintained at 21 ± 1°C as in the CON. At the 42nd day experiment, we calculated the growth performance (<i>n</i> = 8) of broilers and collected 3 and 6 cecal tissues for transcriptomic and metabolomic investigation and 4 cecal contents for metagenomic investigation of each treatment. The results indicate that heat stress significantly reduced the average daily gain and body weight of broilers (value of <i>p</i> < 0.05). Transcriptome KEGG enrichment showed that the differential genes were mainly enriched in the NF-kB signaling pathway. Metabolomics results showed that KEGG enrichment showed that the differential metabolites were mainly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway. 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing results indicated that heat stress increased the relative abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> decreased the relative abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i>. Multi-omics analysis showed that the co-participating pathway of differential genes, metabolites and microorganisms KEGG enrichment was purine metabolism. Pearson correlation analysis found that ornithine was positively correlated with <i>SULT1C3</i>, <i>GSTT1L</i> and <i>g_Lactobacillus</i>, and negatively correlated with <i>CALB1</i>. PE was negatively correlated with <i>CALB1</i> and <i>CHAC1</i>, and positively with <i>g_Alistipes</i>. In conclusion, heat stress can generate large amounts of reactive oxygen and increase the types of harmful bacteria, reduce intestinal nutrient absorption and antioxidant capacity, and thereby damage intestinal health and immune function, and reduce growth performance indicators. This biological process is manifested in the complex regulation, providing a foundational theoretical basis for solving the problem of heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Poultry industry has been recognized as a fast-developing sector aiming to produce low-cost and high-nutrient foods for human consumption. This review article aimed to focus on the significant roles of dietary betaine supplementation in the poultry industry. In this respect, different effects of betaine on performance and carcass traits, as well as its osmoregulatory, anticoccidial, immune-modulatory, and heat-stress alleviation activities, were discussed. Different concentrations of betaine supplementation can improve the feed conversion ratio, final body weight, breast muscle yield, egg production ratio, and reduce body fat contents in broiler chicken, turkey, duck, geese, and quail diets. Betaine supplemented with methyl groups can eliminate the need to have some methyl-group donors, including choline and methionine, therefore having positive effects on feed conversion ratio in poultry diets. The osmolytic character of betaine can alleviate heat stress and have a positive impact on tonic immobility, which consequently reduces stress in poultry. By inhibiting distinct developmental stages of <i>Eimeria</i> species, betaine reduces the damaging effects of coccidiosis on broiler chickens and improves intestinal structure and function. The immunological, cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and hepatic metabolic systems benefit from betaine's osmo-protective properties. Therefore, betaine has the potential to be considered as an alternative to feed additives and enhances the health status and productive performance of poultry.",

The results showed that 7 d heat exposure caused microvesicular steatosis and reduced glutamine synthetase activity in broiler liver (P < 0.05). After 14 d of heat exposure, heat stress caused vacuolar degeneration and apoptosis in the liver; elevated liver relative weight and liver glutaminase activity as well as plasma ammonia level (P < 0.05). Additionally, heat stress enhanced GRP78 protein expression and the mRNA expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses genes and apoptosis-related genes in broiler liver after 14 d of heat exposure (P < 0.05). In conclusion, chronic heat stress triggered ER stress-induced apoptosis and caused liver damage, which may compromise ammonia detoxification in broiler liver.",

    "abstract": "Broiler chicken meat is a good source of protein consumed universally, and is one of the most commonly farmed species in world. In addition to providing food, poultry non-edible byproducts also have value. A major advantage of broiler chicken production is their short production cycle, which results in a greater rate of production in comparison to other species. However, as with any production system, there are constraints in broiler production with one of the most pressing being energy requirements to keep the birds warm as chicks and cool later in the growth cycle, as a result of the cost needing mechanical heating and cooling. While this is feasible in more advanced economies, this is not readily affordable in developing economies. As a result, farmers rely on natural ventilation to cool the rearing houses, which generally becoming excessively warm with the resultant heat stress on the birds. Since little can be done without resorting to mechanical ventilation and cooling, exploring the use of other means to reduce heat stress is needed. For this review, we cover the various factors that induce heat stress, the physiological and behavioral responses of broiler chickens to heat stress. We also look at mitigating the adverse effect of heat stress through the use of antioxidants which possess either an anti-stress and/or antioxidant effects.",

However, the results of this experiment showed that there can be changes in the redness colour of the breast meat when DQH is fed. No negative effects of feeding DHQ at 0.5 g/kg diet were observed in this study.4. Supplementation of poultry diets with DHQ under standard industry-rearing conditions did not improve the performance or any of the studied variables, except an increase of redness index of the breast fillets.

    "abstract": "Heat stress has been considered as a critical risk factor for decreasing performance and causing oxidative stress in broilers. The tryptophan (TRP) derivative 5-hydroxytryptophan has been reported to protect membrane fluidity in broilers suffering from oxidative stress. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary TRP supplementation on antioxidant status and mitochondrial function-related genes expressions in broilers exposed to acute heat stress (34 ± 1°C, 24 h). Female Arbor Acres broilers (19-d-old, <i>n</i> = 180) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments. Broilers were fed a basal diet and in the thermoneutral conditions (TN, 23 ± 1°C) was considered as the TN group. Broilers were fed a basal diet and exposed to acute heat stress (HS, 34 ± 1°C) was regarded as the HS group. Broilers were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.18% L-tryptophan and under HS conditions was treated as the HS + TRP groups. Heat stress led to increased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while it elevated catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capacity activities (T-AOC) (<i>P</i> < 0.05) compared with the TN group. Nevertheless, compared with the HS group, TRP supplementation increased SOD activity (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The effects of acute heat stress were associated with increased mRNA abundance for redox-related genes (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and reduced mRNA levels for mitochondrial function-related genes (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Notably, the effects of acute heat stress on mitochondrial function-related genes expressions were reversed by TRP treatment. Collectively, dietary 0.18% TRP supplementation beneficially protects against acute heat stress-induced oxidation stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating antioxidant states and increasing mitochondrial function-related genes expressions in broilers.",

    "abstract": "Poultry meat and egg production benefits from a smaller carbon footprint, as well as feed and water consumption, per unit of product, than other protein sources. Therefore, maintaining a sustainable production of poultry meat is important to meet the increasing global demand for this staple. Heat stress experienced during the summer season or in tropical/subtropical areas negatively affects the productivity and health of chickens. Crucially, its impact is predicted to grow with the acceleration of global warming. Heat stress affects the physiology, metabolism, and immune response of chickens, causing electrolyte imbalance, oxidative stress, endocrine disorders, inflammation, and immunosuppression. These changes do not occur independently, pointing to a systemic mechanism. Recently, intestinal homeostasis has been identified as an important contributor to nutrient absorption and the progression of systemic inflammation. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve neuroendocrine signaling, antioxidant response, the presence of oxidants in the diet, and microbiota composition. The present review focuses on the effect of heat stress on intestinal dysfunction in chickens and the underlying causative factors. Understanding these mechanisms will direct the design of strategies to mitigate the negative effect of heat stress, while benefiting both animal health and sustainable poultry production.",

Resveratrol, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory natural plant polyphenol, is widely used in agriculture for the prevention of oxidative stress-related diseases. This study aimed to explore the effects and potential mechanism of resveratrol on liver oxidative damage in heat-stressed broilers. Sixty SPF chickens were randomly divided into control, heat stress (HS) and HS+ resveratrol (resveratrol) groups. Broilers were exposed to 35 ± 2 ℃ (8 h/d) for 7 consecutive days to induce HS, and the other 16 h/d were kept at 23 ± 2 ℃, similar to the control group. Broilers received 400 mg/kg resveratrol in the basic diet 2 days before exposure to HS and for the following 7 days. The results showed that resveratrol improved growth performance by increasing the average daily gain (ADG) and reducing the feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared with the HS group. Heat stress reduced liver weight and index, increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver, enhanced serum AST levels, and decreased TP and ALB II levels, which resulted in liver injury in broilers, and resveratrol effectively alleviated liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with resveratrol enhanced the activities of liver antioxidant enzymes resulting in higher GPX and SOD levels than those in the heat-stressed broilers, and decreased MDA levels. Furthermore, resveratrol alleviated liver oxidative stress by activating the gene and protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1, enhancing NQO1 and SOD1 gene levels, and decreasing protein levels of HSP70, p62, and Keap1, and thereby alleviated the liver injury of heat-stressed broilers. Compared with the HS group, Nrf2 immunofluorescence was significantly up-regulated in the livers of resveratrol group. These results suggest that resveratrol can enhance the liver antioxidant function by activating the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway to promote growth performance in broilers under HS.",

Physiologically, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are generated by GIT epithelial cells either from oxygen metabolism or by enteric commensal bacteria and regulate gut health. However, increased production of ROS elevates free radical production and antioxidant insults resulting in oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in poultry GIT is derived from nutritional, environmental heat stress, and pathological factors, which alters overall performance as well as meat and egg quality. Supplementation of exogenous vitamins, antioxidants, and plant extract having antioxidant properties scavenge ROS and are beneficial in mitigating oxidative stress in the GIT.

Especially enteric infectious diseases of weaned pigs and broiler chickens are responsible for a high antibiotic consumption, and there is a major request for alternative strategies to enhance animal disease resistance and robustness. The aim of this presentation was to address the role of oxidative stress and inflammation to combat infectious pathogens, and to elucidate how the reactive processes will contribute to normal immune defense mechanisms of the animal. Furthermore, factors that can enhance oxidative stress (e.g., intensive production, heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and impaired fat quality), uncontrolled inflammatory reactions (e.g., high ratio of n-6 and n-3 in cellular membranes), and limited immune development (such as micronutrient deficiency) are addressed. In addition, the presentation reviews how micronutrient supplementation during critical phases can support a normal immune system and modulate resistance to infectious diseases of pigs and poultry. The mechanisms concern especially modulation of signal transduction in leukocytes (fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids) and protection against immunopathology, as exerted by the antioxidative vitamins and selenium. Substantial advances in optimized gut health could be expected by increasing our understanding on how to foster or inhibit production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory reaction; the relation to enteric pathogens, and how to monitor the effect of disease prevention in farm animals by the use of antioxidant therapy and antibacterial feed components.",

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to assess the response of broilers to arginine supplementation and cyclic HS, with a focus on liver, pectoral muscle, and blood metabolic profiles and the cecal microbiota. Day-old male Ross 308 broilers (<i>n</i> = 240) were placed in 2 rooms with 12 pens each for a 44-day trial. Pens were assigned to one of two groups (6 pens/group/room): the control group (CON) was given a basal diet in mash form and the treated group (ARG) was fed CON diet supplemented with crystalline <i>L</i>-arginine. The total arginine:lysine ratio of CON diet ranged between 1.02 and 1.07, while that of ARG diet was 1.20. One room was constantly kept at thermoneutral (TN) conditions, while the birds in the other room were kept at TN conditions until D34 and subjected to cyclic HS from D35 onwards (∼34°C; 9:00 A.M.-6:00 P.M.). Blood, liver, <i>Pectoralis major</i> muscle, and cecal content were taken from 2 birds per pen (12 birds/group/room) for metabolomics and microbiota analysis. Growth performance data were also collected on a pen basis. Arginine supplementation failed to reduce the adverse effects of HS on growth performance. Supplemented birds showed increased levels of arginine and creatine in plasma, liver, and <i>P. major</i> and methionine in liver, and reduced levels of glutamine in plasma, liver, and <i>P. major</i>. HS altered bioenergetic processes (increased levels of AMP and reduced levels of fumarate, succinate, and UDP), protein metabolism (increased protein breakdown to supply the liver with amino acids for energy production), and promoted the accumulation of antioxidant and protective molecules (histidine-containing dipeptides, beta-alanine, and choline), especially in <i>P. major</i>. Arginine supplementation may have partially counterbalanced the effects of HS on energy homeostasis by increasing creatine levels and attenuating the increase in AMP levels, particularly in <i>P. major</i>. It also significantly reduced cecal observed diversity, while HS increased alpha diversity indices and affected beta diversity.

    "title": "Resveratrol Attenuates Heat Stress-Induced Impairment of Meat Quality in Broilers by Regulating the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway.",
    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Studies have indicated that dietary resveratrol (RES) improves the meat quality of broilers subjected to heat stress (HS), but the mechanism of action remains unclear. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of RES on meat quality, muscle antioxidant status, and its mechanism of action in broilers under HS. A total of 162 male AA broilers at 21 days old with similar weight were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups with 6 replicates each. The control group (ambient temperature: 22 ± 1 °C) and HS group (ambient temperature: 33 ± 1 °C for 10 h a day from 8:00 to 18:00 and 22 ± 1 °C for the remaining time) were fed a basal diet and the HS + RES group was fed a basal diet with 400 mg/kg RES. The feeding was conducted for 21 continuous days. The results indicated that HS decreased final body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), breast and leg muscle yield, a*24h, pH24h, the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2−related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and GSH-Px (p < 0.05). HS also increased b*45min, L*24h, drip loss, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and kelch-like epichlorohydrin-associated protein 1 (Keap1) mRNA level (p < 0.05). Compared with the HS group, the HS + RES group exhibited a higher ADG, breast and leg muscle yield, a*24h, pH24h, activities of GST and GSH-Px, and mRNA levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 but had lower drip loss and Keap1 mRNA level (p < 0.05). RES can improve meat quality and the muscle antioxidant ability of heat-stressed broilers by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the use of a wide range of phytoadditives to counteract the harmful effects of heat stress in poultry. Willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) is a tree with a long history. Among various forms, willow bark is an important natural source of salicin, β-O-glucoside of saligenin, but also of polyphenols (flavonoids and condensed tannins) with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activity. In light of this, the current review presents some literature data aiming to: (1) describe the relationship between heat stress and oxidative stress in broilers, (2) present or summarize literature data on the chemical composition of <i>Salix</i> species, (3) summarize the mechanisms of action of willow bark in heat-stressed broilers, and (4) present different biological effects of the extract of <i>Salix</i> species in different experimental models.",

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Heat stress has become a serious problem in poultry industry along with rising of the global temperatures. High environmental temperature causes deleterious impacts on physiology and immunology of poultry and impairs their productivity. Heat stress is linked to compromised productivity through a decline in growth rate, feed utilization, blood biochemistry and immunity. In addition, heat stress induced adverse effects on mineral balance of birds and the extent of such effects depended on the type of mineral and the severity of heat stress. Exposure of broilers to high temperature adversely affects mineral metabolism and their excretion route and reduced the retention of some minerals like P, Na, K, S, Mg, Mn, Zn and Cu. On the other hand, the effect of climate on intestinal microbiota has been described in a number of studies. Where, exposure to heat stress can also increase the colonization of Salmonella in the intestine and increase the susceptibility of birds to E. coli and change ileal contents. It is also characterized by decreased antioxidant enzymes in poultry species, resulting in increased oxidative stress that means presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in excess of the available antioxidant capacity of animal cells. However, further studies are still required to increase the information and knowledge of basic mechanisms associated with the consequences of heat stress on poultry. This article focuses on the scientific evidence available on the negative role of heat stress on physiological responses, biochemical blood parameters, immunity, antioxidant, mineral balance, acid-base balance, osmoregulation, body and rectal temperature, intestinal and ileal microbiota as well as the parameters related to thyroid, liver and kidney functions in some poultry species.",

    "title": "Radical Response: Effects of Heat Stress-Induced Oxidative Stress on Lipid Metabolism in the Avian Liver.",
    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism in avian species places unique demands on the liver in comparison to most mammals. The avian liver synthesizes the vast majority of fatty acids that provide energy and support cell membrane synthesis throughout the bird. Egg production intensifies demands to the liver as hepatic lipids are needed to create the yolk. The enzymatic reactions that underlie de novo lipogenesis are energetically demanding and require a precise balance of vitamins and cofactors to proceed efficiently. External stressors such as overnutrition or nutrient deficiency can disrupt this balance and compromise the liver's ability to support metabolic needs. Heat stress is an increasingly prevalent environmental factor that impairs lipid metabolism in the avian liver. The effects of heat stress-induced oxidative stress on hepatic lipid metabolism are of particular concern in modern commercial chickens due to the threat to global poultry production. Chickens are highly vulnerable to heat stress because of their limited capacity to dissipate heat, high metabolic activity, high internal body temperature, and narrow zone of thermal tolerance. Modern lines of both broiler (meat-type) and layer (egg-type) chickens are especially sensitive to heat stress because of the high rates of mitochondrial metabolism. While this oxidative metabolism supports growth and egg production, it also yields oxidative stress that can damage mitochondria, cellular membranes and proteins, making the birds more vulnerable to other stressors in the environment. Studies to date indicate that oxidative and heat stress interact to disrupt hepatic lipid metabolism and compromise performance and well-being in both broilers and layers. The purpose of this review is to summarize the impact of heat stress-induced oxidative stress on lipid metabolism in the avian liver. Recent advances that shed light on molecular mechanisms and potential nutritional/managerial strategies to counteract the negative effects of heat stress-induced oxidative stress to the avian liver are also integrated.",

    "title": "Probiotics in poultry feed: A comprehensive review.",
    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "The use of antibiotics to maintain animal well-being, promote growth and improve efficiency has been practised for more than 50 years. However, as early as the 1950s, researchers identified concern on the development of resistant bacteria for the antibiotics streptomycin and tetracycline used in turkeys and broilers respectively. These findings laid the groundwork for agricultural officials to impose stricter regulatory parameters on the use of antibiotics in poultry feeds. Probiotics are live micro-organisms included in the diet of animals as feed additives or supplements. Commonly known as a direct-fed microbial, probiotics provide beneficial properties to the host, primarily through action in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the animal. Supplementation of probiotics in the diet can improve animal health and performance, through contributions to gut health and nutrient use. For instance, supplementation of probiotics has been demonstrated to benefit farm animals in immune modulation, structural modulation and increased cytokine production, which positively affect the intestinal mucosal lining against pathogens. Bacillus subtilis has been a popular bacterium used within the industry and was shown to improve intestinal villus height. Increasing the villus height and structure of the crypts in the GIT allows for the improvement of nutrient digestion and absorption. Tight junctions maintain important defences against pathogenic bacteria and cellular homeostasis. Heat stress can be a major environmental challenge in the poultry industry. Heat stress causes the bird to fluctuate its internal core temperature beyond their comfort zone. To overcome such challenges, poultry will attempt to balance its heat production and dissipation through behavioural and physiological adaptation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to assess the effect of dietary betaine (B) and/or creatine (C) on performance and thermoregulatory responses of broiler chicks. Indian River broiler chicks, fitted with compact thermosensors, were reared to market age (five weeks). The chicks were randomly distributed into four treatment groups, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments-basal control diet (Control group: CONT; B-/C-); 1 g betaine/kg feed (Betaine group: BETA; B+/C-), 1.2 g creatine monohydrate/kg feed (Creatine group: CRET; B-/C+), and combination (Betaine and Creatine group: COMB; B+/C+) of both supplements. At 31 days of age, 20 chicks from each group were exposed to acute heat stress (A-HS) for 3 h (34.45 ± 0.20 °C), and hemogramic profiles were screened before and after. Performance parameters (feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio) were reported on a weekly basis, and carcass meat quality was evaluated at the end of experiment. Redness of breast was higher due to B and C treatments separately than the CONT group (B by C interaction; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Compared to the CONT, dietary supplements alleviated hyperthermia responses, with B alone being more efficient than C or COMB treatments. The mitigation of hyperthermia is likely mediated by enhancement of water balance indicators. Although not efficient in improving growth performance, dietary B and/or C are efficient in improving thermophysiological performance and survival of finishing broiler chicks under A-HS.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Lycopene is a type of carotenoid pigment widely distributed in various plants and fruits, with tomatoes, carrots, and guava being the most abundant sources. Due to its high content of beneficial active components, lycopene has been used in medicine, where it is employed as a dietary additive for cancer therapy, immune modulator, and feed additive to improve livestock productivity. Lycopene is a lipophilic substance that can act as either a prooxidant or a free radical scavenger and is particularly efficient in enhancing broiler performance. Furthermore, lycopene can alleviate heat stress by improving the activity of various antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT), as well as increasing the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and nuclear muscle factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), while simultaneously reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and muscle Keap1 expression. In addition, lycopene can improve broiler fertility by enhancing sperm performance and reducing inflammation by modulating the levels of interleukin 1, 2, and 10 (IL-1, IL-2, and IL-10) in cases of infection. In cases of disease by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), lycopene can modulate interferon-<i>γ</i> (IFN-<i>γ</i>), IL-1, claudin-1 (CLDN-1), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, under the lipopolysaccharide challenge, lycopene can increase the relative weights of immune organ indices such as the bursal, spleen, and thymus.",

We evaluated the expression of genes related to antioxidant capacity, the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the liver, as well as oxidative stress markers in the liver and plasma. The experiment had a completely randomized factorial design with two thermal environments (thermoneutral and HS, 38°C for 24 h) and two ages (21 and 42 days). Twenty-one-day-old animals exposed to HS showed the highest thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) (P<0.0001) and glutathione synthetase (GSS) (P<0.0001) gene expression levels. Age influenced the expression of the thioredoxin (Trx) (P=0.0090), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (P=0.0194), glutathione reductase (GSR) (P<0.0001) and glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPx7) (P<0.0001) genes; we observed greater expression in birds at 21 days than at 42 days. Forty-two-day-old HS birds showed the highest H2O2 production (222.31 pmol dichlorofluorescein produced/min×mg mitochondrial protein). We also verified the effects of age and environment on the liver content of Glutathione (GSH) (P<0.0001 and P=0.0039, respectively) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activity (P=0.0007 and P=0.0004, respectively). Higher GSH content and lower CAT activity were observed in animals from the thermoneutral environment compared with the HS environment and in animals at 21 days compared with 42 days. Broilers at 42 days of age had higher plasma creatinine content (0.05 v. 0.01 mg/dl) and higher aspartate aminotransferase activity (546.50 v. 230.67 U/l) than chickens at 21 days of age. Our results suggest that under HS conditions, in which there is higher H2O2 production, 21-day-old broilers have greater antioxidant capacity than 42-day-old animals.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary betaine (BET) on growth performance, redox state, and related gene expression in broilers under heat stress (HS). A total of 144 21-day-old male broiler chickens with similar body weights were assigned randomly to three treatments with six replicates (eight chickens per replicate cage). Broilers in the control (CON) group were kept at thermoneutral (TN, 22±1°C) conditions and fed a basal diet until they were 42 days of age. Broilers in the other two groups (defined as HS and HS + BET) were exposed to HS (34±1°C, 8 h/day) and fed the basal diet without or with 1000 mg/kg BET, respectively. Rectal and cockscomb temperature of broilers was increased (<i>P</i><0.05) in HS and HS + BET groups compared with the CON group, whereas there was no difference between HS and HS + BET groups. Dietary BET supplementation restored (<i>P</i><0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of broilers and reversed (<i>P</i><0.05) the increase in serum alanine transaminase (ALT) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver tissue of broilers under HS. The HS + BET group had higher (<i>P</i><0.05) activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in the liver tissue and mitochondria than the HS group, and the same pattern was observed for glutathione (GSH) and GSH/glutathione disulphide (GSSG) in the liver tissue. The decreased mRNA levels of GPX1 and uncoupling protein (UCP) in the liver induced by HS were restored by BET supplementation. In conclusion, dietary BET supplementation can alleviate HS-induced hepatic and mitochondrial oxidative damage of broilers by regulating mRNA expressions of GPX1 and UCP.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Chronic stress is recognized as a secret killer in poultry. It is associated with systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, dysbiosis, and the so-called leaky gut syndrome, which mainly results from oxidative stress reactions that damage the barrier function of the cells lining the gut wall. Poultry, especially the genetically selected broiler breeds, frequently suffer from these chronic stress symptoms when exposed to multiple stressors in their growing environments. Since oxidative stress reactions and inflammatory damages are multi-stage and long-term processes, overshooting immune reactions and their down-stream effects also negatively affect the animal's microbiota, and finally impair its performance and commercial value. Means to counteract oxidative stress in poultry and other animals are, therefore, highly welcome. Many phytogenic substances, including flavonoids and phenolic compounds, are known to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In this review, firstly, the main stressors in poultry, such as heat stress, mycotoxins, dysbiosis and diets that contain oxidized lipids that trigger oxidative stress and inflammation, are discussed, along with the key transcription factors involved in the related signal transduction pathways. Secondly, the most promising phytogenic substances and their current applications to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation in poultry are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of heat stress (HS) on performance, digestibility, and molecular transporters of amino acids in broilers. Cobb 500 chicks were raised from hatch till 13 d in floor pens. At d 14, 48 birds were randomly and equally divided between a control group (25°C) and a HS treatment group (35°C). Birds in both treatment classes were individually caged and fed ad libitum on a diet containing 18.7% CP and 3,560 Kcal ME/Kg. Five birds per treatment at one and 12 d post treatment were euthanized and the Pectoralis major (P. major) and ileum were sampled for gene expression analysis. At d 33, ileal contents were collected and used for digestibility analysis. Broilers under HS had reduced growth and feed intake compared to controls. Although the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) was consistently higher for all amino acids in the HS group, it was not significant except for hydroxylysine. The amino acid consumption and retention were significantly lower in the HS group when compared to the control group. Meanwhile, the retention of amino acids per BWG was higher in the HS group when compared to the control group except for hydroxylysine and ornithine. The dynamics of amino acid transporters in the P. major and ileum was influenced by HS. In P. major and ileum tissues at d one, transporters SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT7, TAT1, and b0,+AT, were down-regulated in the HS group. Meanwhile, LAT4 and B0AT were down-regulated only in the P. major in the treatment group. The amino acid transporters B0AT and SNAT7 at d 12 post HS were down-regulated in the P. major and ileum, but SNAT2 was down-regulated only in the ileum and TAT1 was down-regulated only in the P. major compared with the control group. These changes in amino acid transporters may explain the reduced growth in meat type chickens under heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) in poultry husbandry is an important stressor and with increasing global temperatures its importance will increase. The negative effects of stress on the quality and quantity of poultry production are described in a range of research studies. However, a lack of attention is devoted to the impacts of HS on individual chicken immune cells and whole lymphoid tissue in birds. Oxidative stress and increased inflammation are accompanying processes of HS, but with deleterious effects on the whole organism. They play a key role in the inflammation and oxidative stress of the chicken immune system. There are a range of strategies that can help mitigate the adverse effects of HS in poultry. Phytochemicals are well studied and some of them report promising results to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation, a major consequence of HS. Current studies revealed that mitigating these two main impacts of HS will be a key factor in solving the problem of increasing temperatures in poultry production. Improved function of the chicken immune system is another benefit of using phytochemicals in poultry due to the importance of poultry health management in today's post pandemic world. Based on the current literature, baicalin and baicalein have proven to have strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in mammalian and avian models. Taken together, this review is dedicated to collecting the literature about the known effects of HS on chicken immune cells and lymphoid tissue. The second part of the review is dedicated to the potential use of baicalin and baicalein in poultry to mitigate the negative impacts of HS on poultry production.",

Two hundred and seventy 21-day-old Arbor Acres broilers with similar body weight (1298 ± 28 g) were selected for a 3-week trial (29-49 days of age). The broilers were randomly assigned to three groups including the control group, constant heat stress group and pair-fed group. Up-regulation of the rectal temperature and the mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 in liver indicate that the model for constant heat stress was success. The average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, breast and thigh muscle weight, percentage of breast muscle, crude protein content in breast and thigh muscle in constant heat stress group were significantly lower than in control group and pair-fed group. Serum uric acid content and the glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity were significantly higher, while protein content and glutamic-pyruvate transaminase activity were significantly lower in liver of heat stress group than of the control and pair-fed groups. The expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6 kinase associated with protein synthesis were lower in breast muscle but higher in thigh muscle in heat stress group compared to the control or fed-pair groups. In thigh muscles, the expression of muscle ring-finger protein-1 and MAFbx associated with protein degradation were higher in the heat stress group than in the control and pair-fed groups. Poor performance of the birds under heat stress may be due to lower synthesis and increased degradation of proteins.",

The research involved 240 broiler chicks, divided into six groups: control, F-LAB, C-LAB (raised at 24 °C), HS, F-LAB/HS, and C-LAB/HS (exposed to 5-7 h of 34-36 °C daily). The study followed a randomized complete block design, with each group consisting of 40 chicks. F-LAB and HS/F-LAB groups received a natural probiotic added to their drinking water at a rate of 0.5 ml/L, while C-LAB and HS/C-LAB groups were supplemented with a commercial probiotic at the same dosage. Control and HS groups received no probiotic supplementation. The duration of the study was 42 days, with data collected on growth performance, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and health parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA, and significant differences between groups were determined using post hoc tests. The results revealed that without probiotic supplementation, heat stress led to a decrease in body weight gain, T3 levels, citrulline, and growth hormone levels, along with an increase in the feed conversion ratio, serum corticosterone, HSP70, ALT, AST, and leptin levels (p < 0.05 for all). Heat stress also adversely affected cecal microbiota, reducing lactic acid bacteria count (LABC) while increasing Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria (CBC) counts. However, in the groups receiving probiotic supplementation under heat stress (F-LAB/HS and C-LAB/HS), these effects were alleviated (p < 0.05 for all). Particularly noteworthy was the observation that broiler chickens supplemented with natural lactic acid bacteria (F-LAB) exhibited greater resilience to heat stress compared to those receiving the commercial probiotic, as evidenced by improvements in growth, liver function, hormonal balance, intestinal health, and cecal microbiome ecology (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that the supplementation of naturally sourced probiotics (F-LAB) may positively impact the intestinal health of broiler chickens exposed to heat stress, potentially supporting growth and health parameters.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "With the growing global demand for animal protein and rising temperatures caused by climate change, heat stress (HS) is one of the main emerging environmental challenges for the poultry industry. Commercially-reared birds are particularly sensitive to hot temperatures, so adopting production systems that mitigate the adverse effects of HS on bird performance is essential and requires a holistic approach. Feeding and nutrition can play important roles in limiting the heat load on birds; therefore, this review aims to describe the effects of HS on feed intake (FI) and nutrient digestibility and to highlight feeding strategies and nutritional solutions to potentially mitigate some of the deleterious effects of HS on broiler chickens. The reduction of FI is one of the main behavioral changes induced by hot temperatures as birds attempt to limit heat production associated with the digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients. Although the intensity and length of the heat period influences the type and magnitude of responses, reduced FI explains most of the performance degradation observed in HS broilers, while reduced nutrient digestibility appears to only explain a small proportion of impaired feed efficiency following HS. Targeted feeding strategies, including feed restriction and withdrawal, dual feeding, and wet feeding, have showed some promising results under hot temperatures, but these can be difficult to implement in intensive rearing systems. Concerning diet composition, feeding increased nutrient and energy diets can potentially compensate for decreased FI during HS. Indeed, high energy and high crude protein diets have both been shown to improve bird performance under HS conditions. Specifically, positive results may be obtained with increased added fat concentrations since lipids have a lower thermogenic effect compared to proteins and carbohydrates. Moreover, increased supplementation of some essential amino acids can help support increased amino acid requirements for maintenance functions caused by HS. Further research to better characterize and advance these nutritional strategies will help establish economically viable solutions to enhance productivity, health, welfare, and meat quality of broilers facing HS.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigates the effects of heat stress on the kidney in broilers, based on previous findings which showed that heat stress caused cardiac damage in broilers. Further, the possible renoprotective role of aspirin and the heat shock proteins HSP60 and HSP47 was also investigated. The enzyme levels of urea and uric acid, which are indicators of renal damage, and lactate dehydrogenase, an indicator of oxidative damage, were measured in chickens that were only exposed to heat stress, chickens that were pretreated with aspirin before heat stress, and chickens that were only treated with aspirin. Further, histological examination of renal tissue from the three groups was also performed. Finally, expression of HSP60 and HSP47 was also examined. In the heat stress group, the enzyme measurements were indicative of renal dysfunction and oxidative damage, and the histological findings were indicative of renal ischemia and damage. Aspirin seemed to have a protective effect against the renal damage caused by the stress, based on the enzyme measurements and histopathological findings in the aspirin-treated group. The findings also indicate that aspirin may induce HSP60 and HSP47 expression in renal cells. Finally, the expression patterns of HSP60 and HSP47 indicated that they may play a renoprotective role, as their expression was higher in the aspirin-treated groups. In conclusion, the present findings show that heat stress causes renal damage in poultry and that aspirin may play a protective role against this damage via pathways that involve HSP60 and HSP47.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "The elevation of ambient temperature beyond the thermoneutral zone leads to heat stress, which is a growing health and welfare issue for homeothermic animals aiming to maintain relatively constant reproducibility and survivability. Particularly, global warming over the past decades has resulted in more hot days with more intense, frequent, and long-lasting heat waves, resulting in a global surge in animals suffering from heat stress. Heat stress causes pathophysiological changes in animals, increasing stress sensitivity and immunosuppression, consequently leading to increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and related neuroinflammation. Probiotics, as well as prebiotics and synbiotics, have been used to prevent or reduce stress-induced negative effects on physiological and behavioral homeostasis in humans and various animals. The current data indicate dietary supplementation with a <i>Bacillus subtilis-</i>based probiotic has similar functions in poultry. This review highlights the recent findings on the effects of the probiotic <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> on skeletal health of broiler chickens exposed to heat stress. It provides insights to aid in the development of practical strategies for improving health and performance in poultry.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary tryptophan (Trp) supplementation on serum biochemical indices, antioxidant indices, cytokine levels, mitochondrial biosynthesis, and mitochondrial morphology of heat-stressed broilers. A total of 180 female Arbor Acres broilers (18-day-old) were randomly allocated into three groups with six replicates of 10 broilers each. Broilers in thermoneutral (TN) (23 ± 1 °C) group were fed a basal diet; the other two groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 or 0.18% Trp under heat stress (HS) (34 ± 1 °C for 8 h/day (h/day) and 23 ± 1°C for the remaining time) condition. The heat stress lasted for 21 days (days 21 to 42). The results indicated that heat stress reduced serum total protein content (TP) and decreased the activities of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), but increased the levels of serum uric acid (UA), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-18 (P < 0.05) compared to the TN group. However, dietary supplementation with 0.18% Trp enhanced serum TP content, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), SOD, catalase (CAT) activities, and T-AOC; decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities (P < 0.05); and lowered serum IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 contents (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, heat stress exposure downregulated the mRNA expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A (COX5A) in ileum (P < 0.05) as compared to the TN group. Dietary Trp supplementation enhanced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the mRNA expression of TFAM, COX1 in ileum mucosa (P < 0.05) and ameliorated the damage of mitochondrial structure. Collectively, dietary supplementation with Trp could improve antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial structure and regulate mitochondrial function-related genes and decrease inflammatory response in heat-stressed broilers. Dietary Trp supplementation might be an effective nutritional strategy to protect against heat stress impairment.",

    "abstract": "Yucca contains high a content of saponin that has a glucocorticord-like effect in animals, e.g., anti-inflammation and anti-microbiota. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that dietary supplementation of yucca powder may alleviate heat stress and improve growth performance of growing broilers subjected to cycling high ambient temperature. A total of 240 male broiler chicks (yellow feathered chicken) aged 28 days, with body weight (BW) of 792 ± 43.7 g, were randomly allocated to one of four treatments (6 replicates per treatment): control (normal temperature, 24 ± 2°C, 24 h), fed diets supplemented with 100 mg/kg yucca under normal temperature (<b>Y</b>), high ambient temperature exposure (<b>HT</b>, 34 ± 2°C, 11 h), fed diets supplemented with 100 mg/kg yucca (<b>HT+Y</b>) under high ambient temperature. After 7 days of adaption, the experiment was conducted for 4 weeks (aged 28-56 days). HT significantly reduced feed intake, BW, and average daily gain (ADG) of broiler, but yucca improved the feed intake under HT condition. Yucca supplementation reduced (<i>P</i> < 0.05) the HT-induced increase in temperature of rectum and leg skin. Supplementation of yucca increased the hypothalamic mRNA expression of <i>TRPV2, TRPV4</i>, and <i>TRPM8</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Yucca reduced (<i>P</i> < 0.05) the plasma lipid oxidation product malondialdehyde (<b>MDA</b>), but did not affect the activities of antioxidant enzyme superoxide oxidase (<b>SOD</b>) and glutathione peroxidase (<b>Gpx</b>). Yucca did not affect the plasma neuro peptide Y (<b>NPY</b>), which was reduced by HT, yucca reduced circulation cholecystokinin (<b>CCK</b>) and hypothalamic mRNA expression of <i>CCK</i>. Supplementation of yucca increased the mRNA expression of both heat and cool sensing receptors. The results of the present study indicate that yucca could improve antioxidant status and attenuate the heat stress response by regulating hypothalamic temperature-sensing genes in growing chickens. Besides, yucca supplementation improved feed intake probably through modulating CCK in growing broilers under high ambient temperature.",

    "abstract": "Poultry meat is becoming one of the most important animal protein sources for human beings in terms of health benefits, cost, and production efficiency. Effective genetic selection and nutritional programs have dramatically increased meat yield and broiler production efficiency. However, modern practices in broiler production result in unfavorable meat quality and body composition due to a diverse range of challenging conditions, including bacterial and parasitic infection, heat stress, and the consumption of mycotoxin and oxidized oils. Numerous studies have demonstrated that appropriate nutritional interventions have improved the meat quality and body composition of broiler chickens. Modulating nutritional composition [e.g., energy and crude protein (CP) levels] and amino acids (AA) levels has altered the meat quality and body composition of broiler chickens. The supplementation of bioactive compounds, such as vitamins, probiotics, prebiotics, exogenous enzymes, plant polyphenol compounds, and organic acids, has improved meat quality and changed the body composition of broiler chickens.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Heat stress is one of the most challenging stressors for animal production due to high economic losses resulting from impaired animal's productivity, health and welfare. Despite the fact that all farm animal species are susceptible to heat stress, birds and pigs are particularly sensitive to heat stress due to either lacking or non-functional sweat glands. Convincing evidence in the literature exists that gut dysbiosis, a term used to describe a perturbation of commensal gut microbiota, develops in broilers and pigs under heat stress. Owing to the protective role of commensal bacteria for the gut barrier, gut dysbiosis causes a disruption of the gut barrier leading to endotoxemia, which contributes to the typical characteristics of heat stressed broilers and growing and growing-finishing pigs, such as reduced feed intake, decreased growth and reduced lean carcass weight. A substantial number of studies have shown that feeding of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics is an efficacious strategy to protect broilers from heat stress-induced gut barrier disruption through altering the gut microbiota and promoting all decisive structural, biochemical, and immunological elements of the intestinal barrier. In most of the available studies in heat stressed broilers, the alterations of gut microbiota and improvements of gut barrier function induced by feeding of either probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics were accompanied by an improved productivity, health and/or welfare when compared to non-supplemented broilers exposed to heat stress. These findings indicate that the restoration of gut homeostasis and function is a key target for dietary interventions aiming to provide at least partial protection of broilers from the detrimental impact of heat stress conditions. Despite the fact that the number of studies dealing with the same feeding strategy in heat stressed pigs is limited, the available few studies suggest that feeding of probiotics might also be a suitable approach to enhance productivity, health and welfare in pigs kept under heat stress conditions.",

    "title": "Effects of Dietary Glutamine Supplementation on Heat-Induced Oxidative Stress in Broiler Chickens: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "In avian species, heat stress (HS) is usually the result of being exposed to high ambient temperatures, whereas oxidative stress (OS) results from the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. The current literature suggests that HS often leads to OS. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of dietary supplementation of glutamine on the antioxidant status and growth performances in heat-stressed broilers. A total of 13 studies were deemed eligible after an exhaustive search of the literature from Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. Briefly, the following criteria were used to select the studies: trials performed on broilers; publication in peer-review journals using English as the text language; and sufficient details about the design and inclusion of dietary glutamine as a treatment for HS. Two main categories of outcomes were extracted from the studies included in the review: growth parameters and OS markers. For the meta-analysis, a random effect model was used when the heterogeneity was higher than 50%, and a fixed effect model was applied otherwise. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD), and mean differences (MD) with their confidence intervals (CI) from the studies revealed that dietary glutamine could increase body weight gain (SMD = 0.70, CI = 0.50 to 0.90, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and feed intake (FI) (SMD = 0.64, CI = 0.43 to 0.86, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and reduce the feed conversion ratio (MD = -0.05, CI = -0.07 to -0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.05) in heat-exposed birds. Additionally, higher glutamine (SMD = 1.21, CI = 1.00 to 1.43, <i>p</i> < 0.05), glutathione (SMD = 1.25, CI = 0.88 to 1.62, <i>p</i> < 0.05), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (SMD = 0.97, CI = 0.58 to 1.36, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and catalase (SMD = 0.94, CI = 0.72 to 1.16, <i>p</i> < 0.05) levels were recorded in the serum, breast, and thigh muscle after supplementation of glutamine. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis revealed that malondialdehydes levels were decreased only in the serum (SMD = -0.83, CI = -1.25 to -0.41, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and thigh muscle (SMD = -1.30, CI = -1.86 to -0.35, <i>p</i> < 0.001) while glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was increased in the breast (SMD = 1.32, CI = 0.95 to 1.68, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and thigh muscle (SMD = 1.53, CI = 1.06 to 1.99, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Meta-regression models indicated that longer periods of heat exposure were inversely associated with the effectiveness of dietary glutamine in increasing FI, GPX, and SOD (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Besides, increasing the dietary concentration of glutamine led to higher GPX and SOD levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Taken together, results suggest that dietary supplementation of glutamine can effectively mitigate the deleterious effects of HS by enhancing the antioxidant status and increasing growth performances in broilers.",

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Heat stress negatively affects poultry production and animal health. In response, animals invoke a heat stress response by inducing heat shock proteins (HSPs). Scientists are actively seeking natural products that can enhance the heat shock response. The present study aimed at assessing the effects of a purified rosemary extract comprising antioxidant compounds on the heat shock response and HSP expression profile in broiler chickens. The response of broilers to HS in the presence of purified rosemary extract was assessed using an in vivo myocardial cell model. Pathological lesions of heart tissue were examined microscopically. The levels and activities of enzymes associated with heart damage and oxidative damage were detected. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for HSPs in myocardial cells. The results showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and myocardial CK (CKMB) levels were reduced by the purified rosemary extract before and during heat stress. Heat stress alone increased CK and CKMB levels. The levels of oxidative damage-associated enzymes were compared between the rosemary + heat stress and heat stress-alone groups. The results indicated that in terms of these enzymes, the purified rosemary extract induced a more antioxidative state. Pathological examinations showed that heat stress caused myocardial fiber fracture, karyopyknosis, and degeneration. The addition of purified rosemary extract ameliorated these lesions to some degree, preserving more of the basic structure. Heat stress decreased the cellular levels of crystallin alpha B (CRYAB) and HSP70. The addition of the purified rosemary extract significantly increased the levels of CRYAB and HSP70 during heat stress (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Immunohistochemistry showed that after rosemary treatment, CRYAB and HSP70 showed more intense staining compared with the no heat stress control group. In the rosemary + heat group, after 10 hours of heat stress, the staining intensity of these two proteins remained higher than in the heat stress group. Thus, purified rosemary extract could induce high levels of HSP70 and CRYAB in chicken hearts before and during heat stress. Purified rosemary extract could be used to alleviate heat stress in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress, a widely occurred in subtropical climate regions, causes ecosystem destruction, and intestine injury in humans and animals. As an important compound in the metabolic pathway of choline, dimethylglycine (DMG) shows anti-inflammatory effects. This study examines the beneficial effects of dietary DMG against heat stress-induced intestine injury and further explores the underlying molecular mechanisms using a broiler model. Here, we showed that DMG supplements exhibited positive effects to growth performance, as evidenced by the significantly increased body weight and feed conversion rate. These therapeutic effects attributed to repaired gut barrier integrity, increased content of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, decreased content of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, and down-regulated gene expression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. DMG treatment led to the reshaping of the gut microbiota composition, mainly increasing the short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) strains such as Faecalibacterium, and Marvinbryantia. DMG treatment also increased two main members of SCFAs, including acetate acid and isobutyrate. Particularly, distinct effects were found which mediated the tryptophan metabolism in intestines such as increased tryptophan and 5-HT, which further alleviate the occurrence of intestinal barrier damage caused by heat stress. Additionally, DMG treatment promoted neuroendocrine function and stimulated the hypothalamic neurotransmitter metabolism by activating tryptophan metabolism in the hypothalamus. Overall, DMG supplementation effectively reduced the occurrence of intestinal inflammation induced by heat stress through modulating cecal microbial communities and improving the metabolism function of microbiota gut brain axis. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism by which gut microbiota could improve host health.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Increased average air temperatures and more frequent and prolonged periods of high ambient temperature (HT) associated with global warming will increasingly affect worldwide poultry production. It is thus important to understand how HT impacts poultry physiology and to identify novel approaches to facilitate improved adaptation and thereby maximize poultry growth, health and welfare. Amino acids play a role in many physiological functions, including stress responses, and their relative demand and metabolism are altered tissue-specifically during exposure to HT. For instance, HT decreases plasma citrulline (Cit) in chicks and leucine (Leu) in the embryonic brain and liver. The physiological significance of these changes in amino acids may involve protection of the body from heat stress. Thus, numerous studies have focused on evaluating the effects of dietary administration of amino acids. It was found that oral l-Cit lowered body temperature and increased thermotolerance in layer chicks. When l-Leu was injected into fertile broiler eggs to examine the cause of reduction of Leu in embryos exposed to HT, <i>in ovo</i> feeding of l-Leu improved thermotolerance in broiler chicks. <i>In ovo</i> injection of l-Leu was also found to inhibit weight loss in market-age broilers exposed to chronic HT, giving rise to the possibility of developing a novel biotechnology aimed at minimizing the economic losses to poultry producers during summer heat stress. These findings and the significance of amino acid metabolism in chicks and market-age broilers under HT are summarized and discussed in this review.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Heat stress in poultry is a serious concern, affecting their health and productivity. To effectively address the issue of heat stress, it is essential to include antioxidant-rich compounds in the poultry diet to ensure the proper functioning of the redox system. Microalgae (Spirulina platensis) are rich in antioxidants and have several health benefits in humans and animals. However, its role in health and production and the underlying mechanism in heat-stressed broilers are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect of microalgae supplementation on the health and production of heat-stressed broilers. Cobb500 day-old chicks (N = 144) were raised in litter floor pens (6 pens/treatment and 8 birds/pen). The treatment groups were: 1) no heat stress (NHS), 2) heat stress (HS), and 3) heat stress + 3% microalgae (HS+MAG). The broilers in the HS+MAG group were fed a diet supplemented with 3% microalgae, whereas NHS and HS groups were fed a standard broiler diet. Broilers in the NHS were raised under standard temperature (20°C-24°C), while HS and HS+MAG broilers were subjected to cyclic heat stress from d 22 to 35 (32°C-33°C for 8 h). Heat stress significantly decreased the final body weight, whereas the supplementation of microalgae increased the final body weight of broilers (P < 0.05). The expressions of ileal antioxidant (GPX3), immune-related (IL4), and tight-junction (CLDN2) genes were increased in microalgae-supplemented broilers compared to heat-stressed broilers (P < 0.05). The ileal villus height to crypt depth ratio was improved in microalgae-supplemented broilers (P < 0.05). In addition, microbial alpha, and beta diversities were higher in the HS+MAG group compared to the HS group (P < 0.05). There was an increase in volatile fatty acid-producing bacteria at the genus level, such as Ruminococcus, Ocillospira, Lactobacillus, Oscillobacter, Flavonifractor, and Colidextribacter in the group that received microalgae supplementation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of microalgae improved the growth performances of heat-stressed broilers by improving their physiogenomics. Thus, the dietary inclusion of microalgae can potentially mitigate heat stress in broilers.",

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Heat stress is associated with compromised performance and productivity in poultry due to declines in feed intake, nutrient utilization, growth rate, egg production and quality, and feed efficiency. Emerging evidences have shown that acute heat exposure results in increased production of free radicals and causes oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Additionally, heat stress can influence immune response by changing the expression of cytokines and by making the immune cells more susceptible to oxidative stress. Selenium, as a part of specific selenoproteins, can help to maintain antioxidant defenses, thereby preventing damages to tissues. An optimum response with supplementation of selenium in diet has been found to improve feed intake, body weight gain, feed efficiency, egg production and quality, and antioxidant status in heat-stressed poultry. Selenium compounds are also known to improve immune responses by altering the production of certain cytokines secreted by cells of the immune system and by enhancing the resistance of the immune cells to oxidative stress. It was reported that selenium supplementation had inhibitory effects on tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in heat-stressed broiler chicks, but the details are not completely elucidated. In the present review, the effect of selenium on production performance, nutrient utilization, antioxidative status, and immune responses of heat-stressed poultry is summarized.",

Mechanisms to dissipate excess heat divert energy from efficient production. This includes increased energy expenditure for respiration, oxidative stress and micronutrient absorption.

In this context, the promising functional feed additives appeared to be selenium and vitamins E and C. The fortification of broiler diets with these feed additives has been proven to enhance the function of vital organs, immune system response and growth performance of broilers under heat stress. The current review highlights recent successful experiences in the alleviation of heat stress symptoms in broilers using the above-mentioned additives. Selenium and vitamins E and C enhanced production performance in broiler chickens challenged with acute heat stress. The combination of these additives, by employing multiple mechanisms and through synergistic effects, improves heat stress symptoms more efficiently than their individual forms. Emerging literature reveals that selenium and vitamins E and C are involved in close interactions to protect proteins and lipids from oxidative damage and boost immune system function.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "In this study, 336-day-old corn cob broilers were bought for the poultry experimental station during the months of May and June 2021. Before the arrival of chicks, the brooders, chick feeders, drinkers, humidity, temperature, and feeding management were controlled according to scientific patterns. These birds were randomly divided into seven groups and six replications of eight birds, viz. Group-A (positive control on basal diet only), Group-B (negative control on basal diet and HS), group-C (basal diet + simple Se 0.3 mg/kg feed), Group-D (basal diet + SeNP 0.3 mg/kg feed + HS), Group-E (BD + HS + chitosan), Group-F (BD + Se + COS), and Group-G (nano Se with chitosan 0.3 mg/kg + BD + HS). On the 42<sup>nd</sup> day of research, two birds were selected from each replication and sacrificed after blood collection. The initial data related to feeding intake, live body weight, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were collected before slaughter. The intestinal samples were collected and immediately transferred to formalin after grass morphometry. The live body weight, FCR, feed intake, intestinal histomorphology, relative organ weight, and antioxidant parameters like MDA, SOD, and GPX were significant (P > 0.005) in all groups, with Group-G at the highest, followed by Groups-F, E, D, C, A, and B. Group-B (negative control group) was the most affected group in all aspects because of heat stress and only basal diet. It was concluded that heat stress highly causes a loss in performance, intestinal gross morphology, and histology in poultry, and increases stress conditions, whereas the selenium nanoparticle works to improve the body weight, FCR, and intestinal parameters.",

    "title": "Amino Acid Nutrition and Metabolism in Chickens.",
    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Both poultry meat and eggs provide high-quality animal protein [containing sufficient amounts and proper ratios of amino acids (AAs)] for human consumption and, therefore, play an important role in the growth, development, and health of all individuals. Because there are growing concerns about the suboptimal efficiencies of poultry production and its impact on environmental sustainability, much attention has been paid to the formulation of low-protein diets and precision nutrition through the addition of low-cost crystalline AAs or alternative sources of animal-protein feedstuffs. This necessitates a better understanding of AA nutrition and metabolism in chickens. Although historic nutrition research has focused on nutritionally essential amino acids (EAAs) that are not synthesized or are inadequately synthesized in the body, increasing evidence shows that the traditionally classified nutritionally nonessential amino acids (NEAAs), such as glutamine and glutamate, have physiological and regulatory roles other than protein synthesis in chicken growth and egg production. In addition, like other avian species, chickens do not synthesize adequately glycine or proline (the most abundant AAs in the body but present in plant-source feedstuffs at low content) relative to their nutritional and physiological needs. Therefore, these two AAs must be sufficient in poultry diets. Animal proteins (including ruminant meat & bone meal and hydrolyzed feather meal) are abundant sources of both glycine and proline in chicken nutrition. Clearly, chickens (including broilers and laying hens) have dietary requirements for all proteinogenic AAs to achieve their maximum productivity and maintain optimum health particularly under adverse conditions such as heat stress and disease. This is a paradigm shift in poultry nutrition from the 70-year-old \"ideal protein\" concept that concerned only about EAAs to the focus of functional AAs that include both EAAs and NEAAs.",

    "abstract": "Thermal stress is a tremendous health predicament encountered by poultry farmers with adverse effects on the performance, product stature, health condition, survival, and overall welfare of poultry birds, and so requires urgent dietary user-friendly strategy to curb. This study was conducted with 200-day old broilers for the purpose of investigating the potential of phytogenics in refining the negative effects of heat stress on broiler chicken. Moringa, Phyllanthus and mistletoe leaves were processed as phytogenic supplements and incorporated into standard ration for broilers as treatments B1 (control), B2, B3 and B4 diet during the peak of thermal discomfort in humid tropics. Growth and carcass indices were monitored in a 49-day trial and blood samples were harvested at the end of the ordeal period to assess haematology, serum biochemical and oxidative stress markers with the use of standard procedures. The results obtained showed that the prevailing environmental condition in the study site indicated that the birds were exposed to heat stress. Birds fed on moringa and mistletoe supplements had higher performance index than birds without supplementation during heat stress condition, while birds fed on mistletoe supplement had the highest survival rate across the treatments. The liveweight, slaughter weight, dressed weight and eviscerated weight of heat stressed birds fed on moringa, phyllanthus and mistletoe supplements were significantly higher than birds on control treatment. Heterophyl/lymphocyte ratio of heat stressed birds without supplement were higher than birds on phytogenic supplements, with least values recorded in phyllanthus and mistletoe fed birds. Birds on phytogenic supplement tend to have lower cholesterol profile, lipid peroxidation and better antioxidant profile than birds on control treatment during heat stress conditions. Mistletoe supplementation in broiler ration enhances the survival rate, as well as promotes growth indices better among the phytogenic supplements. However, phytogenic supplements did ameliorate the negative effects of thermal discomfort on performance, physiological and oxidative stress in heat-stressed broiler chicken.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "As an important respiratory organ, the lung is susceptible to damage during heat stress due to the accelerated breathing frequency caused by an increase in environmental temperature. This can affect the growth performance of animals and endanger their health. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of lung tissue damage caused by heat stress. Broilers were randomly divided into a control group (Control) and a heat stress group (HS). The HS group was exposed to 35°C heat stress for 12 h per d from 21-days old, and samples were taken from selected broilers at 28, 35, and 42-days old. The results showed a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the serum and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lungs of broiler chickens across all 3 age groups after heat stress (P < 0.01), while the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) was significantly enhanced at 35-days old (P < 0.01). Heat stress also led to significant increases in various proinflammatory factors in serum and expression levels of HSP60 and HSP70 in lung tissue. Histopathological results showed congestion and bleeding in lung blood vessels, shedding of pulmonary epithelial cells, and a large amount of inflammatory infiltration in the lungs after heat stress. The mRNA expression of TLRs/NF-κB-related genes showed an upward trend (P < 0.05) after heat stress, while the mRNA expression of MLCK, a gene related to pulmonary blood-air barrier, significantly increased after heat stress, and the expression levels of MLC, ZO-1, and occludin decreased in contrast. This change was also confirmed by Western blotting, indicating that the pulmonary blood-air barrier is damaged after heat stress. Heat stress can cause damage to the lung tissue of broiler chickens by disrupting the integrity of the blood-air barrier and increasing permeability. This effect is further augmented by the activation of TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathways leading to an intensified inflammatory response. As heat stress duration progresses, broiler chickens develop thermotolerance, which gradually mitigates the damaging effects induced by heat stress.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different physical forms of feed and feeding programs on nutrient digestibility and performance of grower-finisher broilers under thermoneutrality or thermal stress. Three experiments were conducted using male broiler chickens (n = 720) aged 19-42 d. The design of two of the experiments was fully randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with two forms of feed (mash and pellet) and two nutritional levels (13.19 MJ/kg and 194.8 g/kg CP - normal level and 13.61 MJ/kg and 210.3 g/kg CP - high level). The experiments took place in a climate-controlled room: Experiment 1 at thermoneutrality (21-23 °C and 58-60% relative humidity) for 24 h/day; Experiment 2 under thermal stress cycle (31-32 °C and 63-65% relative humidity), for 6h/day and thermoneutrality (21-23 °C, 58-60% relative humidity) for 18h/day. The nutrient digestibility and performance was analyzed. The design of the third experiment was fully randomized with two ambient condition treatments (thermoneutral and thermal stress) on heat production, caloric increment and net energy. Pellet feed obtained higher digestibility of dry matter, digestibility of crude protein, AME and AMEn (P < 0.05) than mash feed for broilers reared in the thermoneutral environment. At the high nutritional level there was no effect of treatments on the coefficient of dry matter and crude protein (DCCP) (P > 0.05), while the highest digestibility of AME and AMEn were obtained by the high nutritional level diet (P < 0.05). Pellet feed had higher DCCP (P < 0.05) than mash feed for broilers reared under cyclic heat stress. Broiler chickens under cyclic stress experienced increased caloric increment, rectal temperature and respiratory rate. The appropriate strategy to minimize these effects in both ambient conditions is to pellet feed.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this research was to assess cyclic heat stress on gut permeability, bone mineralization, and meat quality in chickens. Two separate trials were directed. 320 day-of-hatch Cobb 500 male chicks were randomly assigned to four thermoneutral (TN) and four cyclic heat stress (HS) chambers with two pens each, providing eight replicates per treatment in each trial (n = 20 chicks/replicate). Environmental conditions in the TN group were established to simulate commercial production settings. Heat stress chickens were exposed to cyclic HS at 35 °C for 12 h/day from days 7−42. Performance parameters, intestinal permeability, bone parameters, meat quality, and leukocyte proportions were estimated. There was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in body weight (BW), BW gain, and feed intake, but the feed conversion ratio increased in chickens under cyclic HS. Moreover, HS chickens had a significantly higher gut permeability, monocyte and basophil levels, but less bone mineralization than TN chickens. Nevertheless, the TN group had significant increases in breast yield, woody breast, and white striping in breast fillets compared to HS. These results present an alternative model to our previously published continuous HS model to better reflect commercial conditions to evaluate commercially available nutraceuticals or products with claims of reducing the severity of heat stress.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) poses a great challenge to the poultry industry by inducing oxidative damage to the liver, endangering the health and production of broilers. As an important type of seaweed polyphenols, phlorotannin has been shown to have antioxidant properties. The present study evaluated the protective effects of dietary phlorotannin on HS-induced liver injury in broilers based on oxidative damage parameters. A total of 108 twenty-one days old male Arbor Acres plus (AA+) broilers were randomly divided into three groups: TN group (thermoneutral, 24 ± 1 °C, fed with basal diet), HS group (HS, 33 ± 1 °C for 8 h/day, fed with basal diet), and HS + phlorotannin group (HS + 600 mg/kg phlorotannin). Each group has six replicate cages with six birds per cage. The feeding experiment lasted 21 days. At the termination of the feeding experiment (42 days old), samples were collected for analysis of morphological and biochemical features. The results showed that HS decreased the liver index, serum albumin (ALB) content, hepatic antioxidant enzymes activities of catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while increasing the hepatic histopathology score, apoptosis rate, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in 42-day-old broilers. Compared with the HS group, dietary phlorotannin improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes (GST and GSH-Px) but decreased the histopathology score and apoptosis rate in the liver (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, HS down-regulated hepatic mRNA expression of <i>CAT1</i>, <i>NQO1</i>, <i>HO-1</i>, and <i>SLC7A11</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while up-regulated hepatic mRNA expression of <i>Keap1</i>, <i>MafG</i>, <i>IκBα</i>, <i>NF-κB P65</i>, <i>IFN-γ</i>, <i>TFR1</i>, <i>ACSL4</i>, <i>Bax,</i> and <i>Caspase-9</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Compared with HS group, dietary phlorotannin up-regulated hepatic mRNA expression of <i>Nrf2</i>, <i>CAT1</i>, <i>MafF</i>, <i>GSTT1</i>, <i>NQO1</i>, <i>HO-1</i>, <i>GCLC</i>, <i>GPX1</i>, <i>TNF-α</i>, <i>Fpn1,</i> and <i>SLC7A11</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while down-regulated hepatic mRNA expression of <i>IκBα</i>, <i>Bax</i>, <i>Caspase-9,</i> and <i>TFR1</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 600 mg/kg phlorotannin could alleviate HS-induced liver injury via regulating oxidative status, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in broilers; these roles of phlorotannin might be associated with the regulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "The poultry industry has improved genetics, nutrition, and management practices, resulting in fast-growing chickens; however, disturbances during embryonic development may affect the entire production cycle and cause irreversible losses to broiler chicken producers. The most crucial time in the chicks' development appears to be the perinatal period, which encompasses the last few days of pre-hatch and the first few days of post-hatch. During this critical period, intestinal development occurs rapidly, and the chicks undergo a metabolic and physiological shift from the utilization of egg nutrients to exogenous feed. However, the nutrient reserve of the egg yolk may not be enough to sustain the late stage of embryonic development and provide energy for the hatching process. In addition, modern hatchery practices cause a delay in access to feed immediately post-hatch, and this can potentially affect the intestinal microbiome, health, development, and growth of the chickens. Development of the <i>in ovo</i> technology allowing for the delivery of bioactive substances into chicken embryos during their development represents a way to accommodate the perinatal period, late embryo development, and post-hatch growth. Many bioactive substances have been delivered through the <i>in ovo</i> technology, including carbohydrates, amino acids, hormones, prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, antibodies, immunostimulants, minerals, and microorganisms with a variety of physiological effects. In this review, we focused on the physiological effects of the <i>in ovo</i> delivery of these substances, including their effects on embryo development, gastrointestinal tract function and health, nutrient digestion, immune system development and function, bone development, overall growth performance, muscle development and meat quality, gastrointestinal tract microbiota development, heat stress response, pathogens exclusion, and birds metabolism, as well as transcriptome and proteome. We believe that this method is widely underestimated and underused by the poultry industry.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on heat stress-induced lung injury in broilers and the mechanism underlying this process. Sixty two-week-old SPF BWEL broilers were randomly divided into the heat stress group (HS), resveratrol group (heat stress + 400 mg/kg resveratrol), and the control group after one week of feeding, with 20 chickens in each group. Broilers in the control group were reared at 23 ± 2 ℃. Those in the HS and resveratrol group were reared under heat stress (35 ℃ ± 2 ℃) for 8 h/day for seven days. Broilers in the resveratrol group were fed a diet supplemented with 400 mg/kg resveratrol two days before the start of the experiment. The feeding was continued for nine days. The results showed that HS decreased body weight (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), and lung weight. It, however, increased the lung index, induced lung congestion, and promoted infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lung. Resveratrol improved growth performance and inhibited heat stress-induced lung damage. Compared with broilers in the control group, the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), Beclin-1, LC3 Ⅰ, and LC3 Ⅱ genes in the lung of heat-stressed broilers was significantly lower. The levels of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), NQO1, and HO-1 showed a similar trend with gene expressions. Immunofluorescence indicated that HS inhibited the expression of Nrf2 and LC3B proteins. Finally, the ratio of LC3 Ⅱ/LC3 Ⅰ was also significantly lower in the HS group. Further analyses revealed that resveratrol supplements in feeds enhanced antioxidation in the lung by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway and autophagy. In conclusion, HS causes oxidative damage and inhibits autophagy in broilers. However, resveratrol protects against lung injury by alleviating oxidative stress and enhancing autophagy.",

    "abstract": "The use of natural antioxidants, in particular polyphenols such as dihydroquercetin (DHQ), in animal nutrition has recently increased in popularity. This may partly be due to the risk of increased incidences of heat stress associated with raising livestock in warmer ambient temperatures, facilitated by global warming, reducing antioxidant capacity. The current research demonstrates the effect of dietary DHQ, vitaminEand standard or high ambient temperatures on growth performance, energy and nutrient metabolism, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development, jejunal villus morphometry and antioxidant status in broiler chickens. Each of the four experimental diets was fed to 16 pens of five birds, which were allocated to four rooms (four pens in each room). The temperature in two rooms was maintained at aconstant 35°C (high temperature; HT), and the temperature in the other two rooms was gradually reduced from 27°C at 7 dof age to 22°C at 20 dof age (standard temperature; ST). Rearing birds at HT reduced feed intake, weight gain, weight of small intestine, total GIT, liver, spleen, heart, villus height, villus surface area and lowered blood glutationperoxidase (GSH-Px). Dietary DHQ increased blood GSH-Px and total antioxidant status, increased heart weight and reduced caecal size. When fed separately, DHQ and vitamin E improved hepatic vitamin E concentration. Feeding vitamin Eincreased spleen and liver weights. When fed together, DHQ and vitamin Ereduced villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio and villus surface area. Temperature and antioxidants did not affect energy and nutrient metabolism. There were no effects of dietary antioxidants on growth performance of broiler chickens and there were no mortalities. At present, it is unclear if feeding antioxidants (in particular DHQ) at different levels, using different dietary formulations, and rearing birds under arange of environmental conditions may be effective at enhancing production performance and bird health in hot ambient climates.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary rutin on the meat quality, antioxidant status and mitochondrial structure and function in the breast muscle of heat-stressed broilers. A total of 192 male broilers were randomly assigned into three groups and treated with normal control (CON), heat stress (34 °C, HS), and HS with 500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> rutin supplementation (HS + Rutin), respectively. Dietary rutin significantly reversed HS-induced decrease in body weight, average daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed efficiency. Rutin supplementation attenuated HS-induced impaired meat quality by decreasing the lightness, drip loss at 24 and 48 h, the peak time of free water (T<sub>22</sub> ) and the peak area ratio of free water (P<sub>22</sub> ), and increasing the pH<sub>24h</sub> and peak area ratio of immobilized water (P<sub>21</sub> ). Rutin supplementation promoted superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activities and total antioxidant capacity, and decreased malondialdehyde levels compared with the HS group. Moreover, rutin attenuated HS-induced mitochondrial damage by increasing the mitochondrial DNA copy number and improving mitochondrial morphology. Dietary rutin significantly increased mitochondrial biogenesis-related mRNA (proliferator-activated γ receptor coactivator-1α [PGC-1α], nuclear respiratory factor 1 [NRF1], and mitochondrial transcription factor A [TFAM]) expression via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. HS significantly increased mitophagy-related genes and proteins (Parkin, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 [PINK1], microtubule associated protein light chain 3-II [LC3-II]) expression, and dietary rutin significantly reversed these alterations. Dietary rutin attenuated the HS-induced decline in meat quality and antioxidant capacity of broilers, which may be related to inhibition of the AMPK/PINK1-Parkin signaling pathway to attenuate mitochondrial damage. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) has become a significant challenge for poultry farming due to an increase in global temperatures. Existing literature suggests that the health effects of HS in chickens are related to its impact on the gastrointestinal tract. While there is evidence of the detrimental consequences of HS on the gut structure, little is known about the effects of HS on the microbial population inhabiting this organ. Fortunately, recent advancements in \"omics\" technologies have made investigating the interaction between HS and the gut microbiota possible. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to assess the effects of HS on chicken gut microbiota. In July 2024, a comprehensive literature search was performed across scientific repositories, including Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Eighteen studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion and a qualitative synthesis of their results was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Current evidence indicates that HS poses a significant challenge to the gastrointestinal system of chickens, resulting in a range of physiological reactions. These changes trigger fierce competition among beneficial microbial species for limited nutrients, promote microbial shifts from obligate to facultative anaerobes, and increase the abundance of microbial species with high resistance to elevated environmental temperatures. Furthermore, the proliferation of pathogens is exacerbated. Ultimately, gut microbiota profiling highlights changes in microbial diversity, alterations in the composition of microbial populations, disruptions in specific microbial functional pathways (tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, antioxidant biosynthesis, and fatty acid degradation), and the breakdown of complex networks that govern microbial interactions. Understanding the complex relationship between HS and microbial shifts within the chicken gut can provide valuable insights for the development of sustainable mitigation strategies. Further research is needed to expand the current knowledge and employ more advanced literature synthesis techniques such as meta-analyses.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress impairs growth performance and alters body protein and amino acid metabolism. This study was investigated to explore how body protein and amino acid metabolism changed under heat stress (HS) and the stress adaptation mechanism. A total of 144 broilers (28 d old) were divided into 3 treatment groups for 1 wk: HS group (32°C), normal control group (22°C), and pair-feeding group (22°C). We found that HS elevated the feed-to-gain ratio, reduced the ADFI and ADG, decreased breast muscle mass and plasma levels of several amino acids (glycine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine), and increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) activity and corticosterone (CORT) level and liver GOT and glutamic pyruvic transaminase activities. Heat stress elevated muscle atrophy F-box mRNA expression and reduced mRNA expression of the 70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase in the breast muscle of broilers. Broilers in the HS group exhibited striking increases of mRNA expressions of solute carrier family 1 member 1, family 3 member 1, family 7 member 1, and family 7 member-like in the liver and liver gluconeogenesis genes (PCKc, PCKm, PC, and FBP1) in comparison with the other 2 groups. In conclusion, HS increased the circulating CORT level and subsequently caused muscle protein breakdown to provide amino acid substrates to liver gluconeogenesis responsible for energy supply.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining and optimising the intestinal barrier (IB) function in poultry has important implications for the health and performance of the birds. As a key aspect of the IB, intestinal permeability (IP) is mainly controlled by complex junctional proteins called tight junction proteins (TJ) that link enterocytes together. The disruption of TJ is associated with increased gut leakage with possible subsequent implications for bacterial translocation, intestinal inflammation, compromised health and performance of the birds. Despite considerable data being available for other species, research on IP in broiler chickens and in general avian species is still an understudied topic. This paper reviews the available literature with a specific focus on IP in broiler chickens with consideration given to practical factors affecting the IP, current assessment methods, markers and nutritional modulation of IP. Several experimental models to induce gut leakage are discussed including pathogens, rye-based diets, feed deprivation and stress-inducing agents such as exogenous glucocorticoids and heat stress. Although various markers including fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran, expression of TJ and bacterial translocation have been widely utilized to study IP, recent studies have identified a number of excreta biomarkers to evaluate intestinal integrity, in particular non-invasive IP. Although the research on various nutrients and feed additives to potentially modulate IP is still at an early stage, the most promising outcomes are anticipated for probiotics, prebiotics, amino acids and those feed ingredients, nutrients and additives with anti-inflammatory properties. Considerable research gaps are identified for the mechanistic mode of action of various nutrients to influence IP under different experimental models. The modulation of IP through various strategies (i.e. nutritional manipulation of diet) may be regarded as a new frontier for disease prevention and improving the health and performance of poultry particularly in an antibiotic-free production system.",

    "title": "Optimizing growth and antioxidant function in heat-stressed broilers with vitamin C and betaine supplementation.",
    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of vitamin C (VC) and/or betaine (Bet) to enhance growth performance, regulate serum metabolism, and bolster antioxidant function aiming to mitigate the impact of heat stress (HS) on broilers. Two hundred Ross 308 broilers at 28 days of age were randomly assigned to five groups. The control group, housed at 24 ± 1℃, was fed a basal diet. High-temperature treatment groups, housed at 32 ± 1℃, received a basal diet with 0 (HS group), 250 mg/kg VC (HSVC group), 1000 mg/kg Bet (HSBe group), and 250 mg/kg VC + 1000 mg/kg Bet (HSVCBe group). On day 42, assessments were made on growth performance, muscle quality, serum biochemistry, and antioxidant function. Results revealed that HS significantly lowered (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI), the degree of redness (a*) in muscles, and serum total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) level. It also reduced (P < 0.01) average daily gain (ADG), and serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level, while increasing (P < 0.05) shear force, serum direct bilirubin (D-BIL), uric acid (UA), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared with the control group. Dietary supplementation of VC and Bet, either alone or in combination, significantly decreased shear force and serum UA level, while increasing ADG and serum T-AOC, T-SOD level compared with the HS group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the addition of VC and/or Bet to the diet proves effective in enhancing the growth performance of HS-exposed broilers through the positive regulation of serum chemical metabolism and the alleviation of oxidative damage.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn), an essential trace element for poultry, plays a crucial role in promoting growth, improving feed conversion efficiency, enhancing antioxidant activity, and preventing disease. This study investigated the impact of different levels and sources of dietary Zn supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal morphology and antioxidant activity of broiler chickens under heat stress conditions. In this experiment, 1024 Xueshan chickens were divided into eight groups and subjected to heat stress conditions with different levels of Zn supplementation (30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, and 90 mg/kg) using organic or inorganic sources. Our findings indicated that dietary Zn supplementation significantly increased the feed-to-weight ratio of broilers during the experimental period under heat stress. Moreover, Zn supplementation positively increased the villus height and villus width in the jejunum and ileum at 74 and 88 days old, with the 60 and 90 mg/kg groups outperforming other groups, and organic Zn was more effective than inorganic Zn. Furthermore, Zn supplementation significantly increased serum antioxidant levels, with higher superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activities, and organic Zn was more effective than inorganic Zn. This study concludes that Zn supplementation is beneficial in mitigating the detrimental impacts of heat stress on broilers. The findings suggest that employing Zn as a strategy can enhance productivity in the poultry industry by positively influencing intestinal morphology and bolstering antioxidant activity to counteract potential stress.",

    "abstract": "The poultry sector demands alternative additives to antibiotics that can be used as performance enhancers. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to evaluate the probiotics effects on performance, intestinal health, and redox status of 720 broilers exposed to heat stress from 15 days of age. Eight dietary treatments were evaluated: basal diet (BD) without antibiotic and probiotic (T1); BD supplemented with antibiotic zinc bacitracin (T2), BD supplemented with commercial probiotic of Bacillus subtilis DSM 17,299 (T3), BD supplemented with non-commercial probiotic of Lactococcus lactis NCDO 2118, Lactobacillus delbrueckii CNRZ 327, Escherichia coli CEC15, or Saccharomyces boulardii (T4 to T7), and BD simultaneously supplemented with the four non-commercial probiotics (T8). Feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion were determined in the period from 1 to 42 days of age. Carcass and cuts yield, abdominal fat deposition, cloacal temperature, weight and length of intestine, activity of myeloperoxidase and eosinophilic peroxidase enzymes in the jejunum, jejunal histomorphometry, relative gene expression in the jejunum (occludin, zonulin, interleukin-8, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, and heat shock protein-70), and liver (heat shock protein-70), in addition to malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase activity in the intestine, liver, and blood, were measured in broilers at 42 days old. As main results, broilers fed T1 diet exhibited lower weight gain (3.222 kg) and worse feed conversion (1.70 kg/kg). However, diets containing non-commercial probiotics resulted in up to 3.584 kg of weight gain and improved feed conversion by up to 10%, similar to that observed for broilers of the T2 and T3 groups.",

    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the effect of methionine isomers (D- and L-methionine) on growth performance, blood metabolite levels, nutrient digestibility, intestinal morphology, and foot pad dermatitis in broilers challenged with acute heat stress. In total, 240 broilers were randomly allocated in a 2×2 factorial arrangement consisting of two dietary treatments (D- vs. L-methionine) and two thermal environmental conditions (thermo-neutral vs. acute heat stress). Methionine isomers were added to the diet as an ingredient according to the diet formulation. The broilers were exposed to acute heat stress at 33°C for 5 h on day 14. The average daily gain and feed conversion ratio of birds fed L-methionine were higher than those fed D-methionine (<i>P</i><0.05) from the time of hatching till 21 days. Induced acute heat stress impaired (<i>P</i><0.05) the daily gain and feed intake of the broilers on day 21. Furthermore, the blood urea nitrogen levels of birds subjected to acute heat stress on days 14 and 21 were higher (<i>P</i><0.05) than those of their counterparts. Longer villi (<i>P</i><0.05) were observed in broilers fed L-methionine-supplemented diet than in those fed D-methionine-supplemented diet on day 14, irrespective of thermal environmental conditions. Heat stress reduced (<i>P</i><0.01) nutrient digestibility of the broilers on days 14 and 21. Higher incidence and severity of foot pad dermatitis were observed (<i>P</i><0.05) in broilers fed diet containing D-methionine than in those fed L-methionine-supplemented diet. In conclusion, L-methionine-supplemented diet improved growth performance, overcame growth depression, and reduced the incidence of foot pad dermatitis when broilers were exposed to acute heat stress in the starter period.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the variations of muscle and plasma metabolites in response to high environmental temperature can provide important information on the molecular mechanisms related to body energy homeostasis in heat-stressed broiler chickens. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic heat stress conditions on the breast muscle (Pectoralis major) and plasma metabolomics profile of broiler chickens by means of an innovative, high-throughput analytical approach such as the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectrometry. A total of 300 Ross 308 male chicks were split into two experimental groups and raised in either thermoneutral conditions for the entire rearing cycle (0-41 days) (TNT group; six replicates of 25 birds/each) or exposed to chronic heat stress conditions (30 °C for 24 h/day) from 35 to 41 days (CHS group; six replicates of 25 birds/each). At processing (41 days), plasma and breast muscle samples were obtained from 12 birds/experimental group and then subjected to <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis. The reduction of BW and feed intake as well as the increase in rectal temperature and heterophil: lymphocyte ratio confirmed that our experimental model was able to stimulate a thermal stress response without significantly affecting mortality. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis revealed that a total of 26 and 19 molecules, mostly related to energy and protein metabolism as well as antioxidant response, showed significantly different concentrations respectively in the breast muscle and plasma in response to the thermal challenge. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study indicated that chronic heat stress significantly modulates the breast muscle and plasma metabolome in fast-growing broiler chickens, allowing to delineate potential metabolic changes that can have important implications in terms of body energy homeostasis, growth performance and product quality.",

    "abstract": "A total of 400 1-d-old Arbor Acres broiler chicks were raised at a recommended environmental temperature from d 1 to 20 (experimental day [ED] = ED1 to ED20). On ED21, the chicks were weighed and reallocated into 5 treatment groups, with 8 replicates of 10 birds each. The 5 treatment groups were as follows: the control group, in which chicks were housed at 22 ± 1°C and fed the basal diet, and the HS, HS-CUR50, HS-CUR100, and HS-CUR200 groups, in which chicks were housed at 34 ± 1°C for 8 h (0900-1700 h) and 22 ± 1°C for the rest time and fed the basal diet with 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg curcumin, respectively. From ED21 to ED42, the heat treatment lasted for 20 consecutive days. The results showed that heat-stressed broilers had greater (P < 0.05) average head surface and rectal temperature on ED21 and ED42 than the non-heat-stressed broilers. Diets supplied with 50 and 100 mg/kg curcumin increased (P < 0.05) the G:F compared to the heat-stressed groups. Mitochondrial malondialdehyde levels, an index of lipid peroxidation, in the breast muscle were 15.15 and 9.09% higher (P < 0.05) in 50 and 100 mg/kg curcumin supplemented groups than that of the heat-stressed group, respectively. Curcumin supplementation (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) increased (P < 0.05) mitochondrial glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and manganese superoxide dismutase activities compared to heat-stressed broilers. Curcumin supplementation (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) resulted in a decrease (P < 0.05) of heat shock protein 70 mRNA levels in the breast muscle. The breast muscle mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and nuclear respiratory factor 1 and 2 in heat-stressed groups was increased (P < 0.05) in response to dietary 100 mg/kg curcumin treatment. Additionally, when compared to the heat-stressed group, mitochondrial transcription factor A mRNA levels were increased (P < 0.05) by 17.64% in the 200 mg/kg curcumin supplemented group. In conclusion, dietary curcumin supplementation prevented heat-stress-impaired growth performance, possibly through improving the antioxidant defense system and enhancing the mitochondrial biogenesis.",

One hundred and eighty 18 days-old female Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into three treatment groups, with six replicates of ten birds in each replicate. The broilers were either raised under thermoneutral conditions (TN, 23 ± 1°C) or subjected to heat stress (34 ± 1°C for 8 h daily). The TN group received a basal diet, and another two heat-stressed groups were fed the basal diet (HS) or the basal diet supplemented with 0.18% Trp (HS + 0.18% Trp) for 21 consecutive days. The basal diet contained 0.18% Trp. Results revealed that HS increased the rectal temperature, serum epinephrine (EPI), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) concentrations (<i>p</i> < 0.05), reduced the bursal index, the levels of serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, IgM, and serotonin (5-HT) as well as the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in cecum (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared with the TN group. Dietary supplementation of Trp decreased the rectal temperature, serum dopamine (DA), EPI, and the levels of CRH and L-kynurenine (<i>p</i> < 0.05), increased the bursal index, the levels of serum IgA, IgM, and 5-HT as well as the relative abundance of <i>Ruminococcus torques group</i> in cecum of heat-stressed broilers (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to HS group.

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Heat stress accounts for substantial economic loss in the poultry industry by altering the health and performance of chickens. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a water and fat-soluble antioxidant which is readily absorbed from the intestine resulting in maximum bioavailability. Moreover, ALA acts as a coenzyme in glucose metabolism and helps generate other antioxidants. Considering these benefits, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation of ALA would help mitigate heat stress in poultry. A total of 72 Day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: no heat stress (NHS), heat stress with basal diet (HS), and heat stress with alpha-lipoic acid (HS+ALA); each treatment group had 6 replicate pens with 4 birds in each pen (n = 24/group). The allocated birds were raised under standard husbandry practices for 3 weeks. After 21 d, birds in the HS and HS+ALA groups were exposed to heat stress (33°C for 8 hours during the day) for 3 weeks, while the NHS group was reared under normal conditions (22-24°C). The HS+ALA group received a basal finisher diet fortified with ALA (500 mg/kg) during the treatment period (22 to 42 d), while other birds were provided with the basal finisher diet. Weekly body weight and feed intake were recorded. The cecum digesta for volatile fatty acids (VFAs) analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing for the gut microbiota analysis; and the ileum tissue samples for histological and gene expression analyses were collected on d 42. Exposure to heat stress decreased (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and final body weight (FBW) in the HS group compared to the NHS group, the supplementation of ALA improved (P<0.05) ADG and FBW in heat-stressed birds. Furthermore, birds in the HS+ALA group had increased (P<0.05) expression of HSP90, PRDX1, GPX3, SOD2, OCLN, and MUC2 genes and higher (P<0.05) concentrations of major VFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The dietary ALA supplementation also improved the villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the HS+ALA group. The microbial diversity analysis revealed significant abundance (P<0.05) of beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae in the cecum of the ALA group. These results indicate that dietary ALA supplementation effectively mitigates the negative effects of heat stress in broilers by improving the expression of heat-shock, tight-junction, antioxidants, and immune-related genes in the intestine, improving villus structures, increasing concentration of major VFAs, and enriching the beneficial microbiota.",

Assessing the impact of thermally stressful environmental conditions on the welfare of broiler chickens is of great importance. Behavioral responses in a novel environment and hematology of broiler chickens administered with betaine and/or ascorbic acid (AA) during the hot-dry season were evaluated.

An open-field test was used to assess behavior. Hematological parameters were obtained using a hematology auto-analyzer. The natural environmental conditions were predominantly outside the thermoneutral zone for broiler chickens. Results demonstrated that treated groups exhibited improved ability to adjust faster to a new environment and better hematological responses than controls, evidenced by enhanced behavioral responses, oxygen-carrying capacity, and immune responses of broiler chickens under unfavorable environmental conditions. Betaine and/or AA administration to broiler chickens improved some behavioral responses, hemoglobin concentrations, packed cell volume, and total leukocyte count during the hot-dry season.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that glycine improves intestinal barrier function through regulating oxidative stress in broilers exposed to heat stress. A total of 300 twenty-one-day-old female Arbor Acres broilers (600 ± 2.5g) was randomly allocated to 5 treatments (6 replicate of 10 birds each). The 5 treatments were as follows: the control group (CON) was kept under thermoneutral condition (24 ± 1°C) and was fed a basal diet. Broilers fed a basal diet and reared under high ambient temperature (HT) were considered as the HT group (34 ± 1°C for 8 h/d). Broilers fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% glycine and exposed to HT were regarded as the HT + glycine treatments. The results exhibited that heat stress reduced growth performance, serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and glutathione (GSH) concentration (P < 0.05); increased activity of serum catalase (CAT) and the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (P < 0.05). HT exposure led to downregulating the mRNA expression of NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), Occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (P < 0.05); enhanced the mRNA levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), CAT, glutathione synthetase (GSS), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) (P < 0.05); impaired the intestinal morphology (P < 0.05); and altered the diversity and community of gut microbiota (P < 0.05). The final body weight (FBW), ADFI, ADG, and gain-to-feed ratio (G: F) increased linearly or quadratically, and the antioxidant capacity was improved (P < 0.05) with glycine supplementation. Glycine treatment increased the villus height (VH), and villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C) of the duodenum linearly or quadratically, and linearly increased the VH of jejunum and ileum. The mRNA expression of Occludin, and ZO-1 were increased linearly in the ileum mucosa of broilers subjected to HT. Collectively, these results demonstrated that glycine supplementation alleviates heat stress-induced dysfunction of antioxidant status and intestinal barrier in broilers.",

The present study investigated the effects of dietary ellagic acid (EA) on the antioxidant system, gut barrier function, and gut microbiota of heat-stressed broilers. Arbor Acres 14-day-old broilers numbering 360 were randomly divided into six groups, including one negative control group (NC) and five experimental groups. The broilers in the NC group were supplemented with a basal diet at a normal temperature (23 ± 2 °C). The broilers in the experimental groups were supplemented with basal diets containing EA at different doses (0, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg) at HS temperature (35 ± 2 °C). The experiment lasted for 4 weeks. Results showed that dietary EA reduced the corticosterone (CORT), LPS, and diamine oxidase (DAO) levels in the serum of heat-stressed broilers. Additionally, dietary EA improved the antioxidant enzyme activity and mRNA levels of Nrf2/HO-1 in the ileum of heat-stressed broilers. The relative abundances of <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Ruminococcus_torques</i>, <i>Rothia</i>, <i>Neisseria</i>, <i>Actinomyces</i>, and <i>Lautropia</i> in the cecum were significantly reduced by the EA supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the LPS, DAO, and MDA in the serum were revealed to be positively correlated with the relative abundances of <i>Rothia, Neisseria, Actinomyces,</i> and <i>Lautropia</i>, while the GSH-px, SOD, and CAT levels in the serum were negatively correlated with the relative abundances of <i>Ruminococcus_torques, Rothia, Neisseria, Actinomyces, Streptococcus,</i> and <i>Lautropia</i>. Taken together, dietary EA improved the antioxidant capacity, intestinal barrier function, and alleviated heat-stressed injuries probably via regulating gut microbiota.",

A total of 450 day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 5 replicate pens (15 birds each) of 6 experimental treatments according to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments including 2 temperature conditions (thermoneutral and heat stress) and 3 supplemental Cr levels (0, 500, and 1,000 μg/kg as CrMet). For induction of heat stress, the house temperature was set at 35 ± 2°C from 15 to 42 d of age. Results showed that the chicks subjected to heat-stress condition had lower (P < 0.01) feed intake, BW gain, and deteriorated (P < 0.05) feed conversion values compared with those kept in the thermoneutral house. Dietary supplementation with CrMet increased (P < 0.01) feed intake and improved (P < 0.01) weight gain and feed efficiency. There were significant Cr level × temperature interactions, so that inclusion of CrMet into the diets was more effective in heat-stressed chicks. Exposure to heat stress suppressed (P < 0.01) cutaneous hypersensivity response to phytohemagglutinin-P injection at 30 d of age, and dietary supplementation of 500 μg Cr/kg induced (P < 0.05) this response, with the greater impacts in heat-stressed chicks, resulting in a significant (P < 0.01) Cr × temperature interaction. Antibody responses against Newcastle and infectious bronchitis disease viruses were diminished (P < 0.01) in heat-stressed chicks. Dietary inclusion of CrMet improved (P < 0.05) antibody responses to different immunostimulants, and this effect was more pronounced in heat-stressed chicks. Exposure to heat stress caused a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the proportion of helper (CD4+) T lymphocytes and increased cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes, resulting in a decreased (P < 0.01) CD4+ to CD8+ ratio in peripheral blood circulation. Supplementation of CrMet to heat-stressed chicks modulated (P < 0.01) plasma corticosterone level. The present findings indicate that dietary CrMet supplementation could alleviate heat-stress-induced growth retardation in broiler chicks. Moreover, supplemental CrMet modulated suppressive effects of heat stress on cellular and humoral immune responses.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary betaine (BT) supplementation on the hepatic transcriptome profiles in broiler chickens raised under heat stress (HS) conditions. A total of 180 (21-d-old) Ross 308 male broiler chicks were allotted to 1 of 3 treatment groups with 6 replicated cages in a completely randomized design. One group was kept under thermoneutral conditions at all times and was fed a basal diet (PC). Other 2 groups were exposed to a cyclic heat stress condition. One of the 2 groups under heat stress conditions was fed the basal diet as a negative control (NC), whereas the other group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.2% BT. All chickens were provided with diets and water ad libitum for 21 d. Following the experiment, the liver samples were collected for RNA sequencing analysis. Broiler chickens in NC and BT group had decreased (p<0.05) growth performance. In the transcriptome analysis, the number of differentially expressed genes were identified in the liver by HS conditions and dietary BT supplementation. In the comparison between NC and PC treatments, genes related to energy and nucleic acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and immune system were altered by HS, which support the reason why heat-stressed poultry had decreased growth performance. In the comparison between NC and BT treatments, genes related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and immune system were differently expressed under HS conditions. HS negatively impacts various physiological processes, including DNA replication, metabolism of amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, and cell cycle progression in broiler chickens. Dietary BT supplementation, however, offers potential counteractive effects by modulating liver function, facilitating gluconeogenesis, and enhancing immune systems. These findings provide a basis for understanding molecular responses by HS and the possible benefits of dietary BT supplementation in broiler chickens exposed to HS.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "The current research was devoted to evaluating the effects on gut microbiota, gastrointestinal peptides, and glucose homeostasis of chromium picolinate applied to heat-stressed broilers. In a 14 d experiment, 220 28-day-old AA broilers were randomly assigned into one thermal-neutral and three high-temperature groups dietary-supplemented with 0, 0.4, or 0.8 mg/kg of chromium as chromium picolinate. The temperature for the thermal-neutral group was set at 21 °C, while that for the other three groups (high temperature) was set at 31 °C. The results showed that the average daily gain and average daily feed intake of the 0.4 mg/kg chromium-supplemented group significantly increased compared with the high-temperature groups (p < 0.05). The content of cholecystokinin in the 0.4 mg/kg group significantly decreased, and the gastric inhibitory polypeptide level was significantly elevated in jejunum (p < 0.05). The cecal microbiota of heat-stressed broilers was substantially different from that of the thermal-neutral group. After diet-supplemented chromium, compared to the high-temperature groups, the 0.4 mg/kg chromium supplemented group was characterized by a reduction of Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria at the phylum level. The Bacilli were elevated, while proportions of Coriobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were reduced significantly at the class level. The proportions of Lactobacillaceae, Christensenellaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae were elevated significantly, while that of Clostridiaceae was reduced significantly at the family level. The proportion of Turicibacter was elevated significantly and the proportions of Olsenella and Ruminococcus were reduced significantly at the genus level (p < 0.05). Compared to the high-temperature groups, in the 0.4 mg/kg chromium-supplemented group, the insulin concentration and insulin resistance index were reduced (p < 0.05), and sodium-glucose transporter 1 expression was up-regulated in jejunum (p < 0.05). Performance, microbiota, gastrointestinal peptides, or serum parameters of the 0.8 mg/kg group were almost unaffected by chromium compared with the high-temperature groups. In conclusion, diet supplemented with 0.4 mg/kg Cr improved performance, insulin resistance and sodium-glucose transporter 1 expression and altered gut microflora structure and secretion of gastrointestinal peptides, thus showing that supplementation with chromium is beneficial to maintain glucose homeostasis and alleviate heat stress.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Chronic heat stress can result in oxidative damage from increased reactive oxygen species. One proposed method to alleviate the chronic effects of HS is the supplementation of sulfur amino acids (SAA) which can be metabolized to glutathione, an important antioxidant. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of dietary SAA content on broiler chickens exposed to HS from 28 to 35 d on broiler performance, body temperature, intestinal permeability, and oxidative status. Four experimental treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial consisting of HS (6 h at 33.3°C followed by 18 h at 27.8°C from 28 to 35 d of age) and Thermoneutral (TN- 22.2°C continuously from 28 to 35 d) and 2 dietary concentrations of SAA formulated at 100% (0.95, 0.87, and 0.80% for starter, grower, and finisher diets) or 130% SAA (1.24, 1.13, and 1.04% for starter, grower, and finisher diets). A total of 648-day-old, male Ross 708 chicks were placed in 36 pens with 18 chicks/pen and 9 replicates per treatment. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial in JMP 14 (P ≤ 0.05). No interaction effects were observed on broiler live performance (P > 0.05). As expected, HS reduced BWG by 92 g and increased FCR by 11 points from 28 to 35 d of age compared to TN, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). The supplementation of SAA had no effect on live performance (P > 0.05). Cloacal temperatures were increased by 1.7, 1.4, and 1.2°C with HS at 28, 31, and 35 d compared to TN, respectively (P ≤ 0.05) and dietary SAA did not alter cloacal temperatures. At 28 d of age, supplementation of SAA to birds exposed to HS interacted as serum FITC-dextran (an indicator of intestinal permeability) was reduced to that of the TN group (P ≤ 0.05). The interaction was lost at 31 d, but HS still increased intestinal permeability (P ≤ 0.05). By 35 d, broilers were able to adapt to the HS conditions and intestinal permeability was unaffected (P > 0.05). Potential oxidative damage was reduced by increased SAA supplementation as indicated by an improvement in the reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione ratio of 5 and 45 % at 28 (P = 0.08) and 35 d (P ≤ 0.05). These data suggest that intestinal permeability is compromised initially and to at least three d of heat exposure before the bird can adjust. However, oxidative damage in the liver of broilers exposed to HS is more chronic, building over the entire 7 d HS period and increased dietary SAA might have some protective effects on both broiler intestinal permeability and oxidative stress responses to HS.",

A total of 400 one-day-old AA broilers were randomly divided into four groups, each containing the same five replicates, with 20 broilers in each replicate. The control (21 °C) and experiment 2 were fed a basic corn−soybean meal diet. Experiment 1 (21 °C) and experiment 3 were fed a basic corn−soybean meal diet with 10 g/kg compound probiotics on days 7 and 28, respectively. The ambient temperature of experiment 2 and experiment 3 was increased to 30−32 °C (9:00−17:00) for 28−42 days, while the temperature for the other time was kept at 21 °C. The results showed that, compared with the control, the production performance and the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in experiment 1 and triglyceride (TG) in experiment 2 increased (p < 0.05). Compared with experiment 2, TG decreased and the production performance increased in experiment 3 (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant change in meat quality indicators. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to analyze the intramuscular fat, abdominal fat and five blood lipid indicators. We found five related modules. Fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, and fat digestion and absorption were the pathways for KEGG enrichment. Additionally, NKX2-1, TAS2R40, PTH, CPB1, SLCO1B3, GNB3 and AQP7 may be the hub genes of compound probiotics regulating lipid metabolism in heat-stressed broilers. In conclusion, this study identified the key genes of compound probiotics regulating lipid metabolism and provided a theoretical basis for the poultry breeding industry to alleviate heat stress.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Continuous exposure to high ambient temperatures brings about a number of oxidative damages in chickens. Copper (Cu), an active component of a number of antioxidative defence components, should arrest these changes to take place although that may not be possible under the standard dosing regimen followed by the industry. To ascertain the optimum dose response that may be beneficial in sustaining the performance of chickens under heat stress (HS), broiler chickens (<i>n</i> = 400) were exposed to high ambient temperature (between 27.2°C and 35.3°C) during 1-35 d. Copper (Cu) as Cu proteinate (Cu-P) at concentrations of 37.5, 75, 112.5, and 150 mg/kg was supplemented to the diet. The negative control (NC) diet did not contain any supplemental Cu. Increasing dietary Cu improved (<i>P</i> < 0.001) body weight, feed intake, and conversion ratio. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol at 21 d (<i>P</i> = 0.009), HDL cholesterol at 35 d (<i>P</i> = 0.008), LDL cholesterol at 21 d (<i>P</i> = 0.015), and triacylglycerol at both 21 d (<i>P</i> = 0.033) and 35 d (<i>P</i> = 0.001) decreased as Cu in the diet increased. As Cu in the diet increased, hemoglobin increased (<i>P</i> = 0.003) at 21 d, and the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio decreased both at 21 d (<i>P</i> = 0.047) and 35 d (<i>P</i> = 0.001). Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities increased when dietary Cu increased to 150 mg/kg (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Liver Cu at 35 d increased linearly with the dose of Cu in the diet (<i>P</i> = 0.0001). Selected bacteria were enumerated in the digesta to ascertain if Cu super-dosing affected their population in any way in the absence of any enteric challenge. <i>Escherichia coli</i> and total <i>Salmonella</i> numbers decreased (<i>P</i> = 0.0001), and total <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) proportionately with dietary Cu. Interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-<i>α</i> gene expression increased linearly (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) as Cu in the diet increased though the response plateaued at 112.5 mg/kg. It was concluded from the present experiment that during conditions of impending HS, dietary supplementation of 112.5 to 150 mg Cu/kg diet as Cu-P may be a novel strategy to alleviate the negative effects of HS without involving any apparent risk of Cu toxicity.",

A total of 400 twenty-eight-day-old AA male broilers were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups, where each group had 5 replicates of 20 broilers. The 4 treatment groups were a heat stress control group (broilers receiving a normal diet) and groups HP I, HP II, and HP Ⅲ, consisting of broilers receiving 1, 5, and 10 g of compound probiotics added to each kilogram of feed, respectively. Compound probiotics (L. casei, L. acidophilus, and B. lactis at a ratio of 1:1:2) were used to formulate a compound probiotic powder, with 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/g of effective viable bacteria. Heat stress treatment was performed at 32 ± 1°C from 9:00 to 17:00 every day from 28 d to 42 d. In d 28 to 42, compared with the HC group, the ADG of broilers in the HP II and III groups was significantly increased (P < 0.05); the ADFI difference between groups was not significant (P > 0.05); the FCR of HP II and III broilers was significantly decreased (P < 0.05); and the FCR of the HP I group increased, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). Transcriptome results demonstrate that 665 differential genes were screened (DEGs; upregulated: 366, downregulated: 299). The DEGs were enriched in the B cell receptor signaling pathway, the intestinal immune network for IgA synthesis, the Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, and other signaling pathways, according to KEGG enrichment analysis. Metabolome analysis identified 92 differential metabolites (DAMs; upregulated: 48, downregulated: 44). KEGG enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment of Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and beta-Alanine metabolism. The combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that the DAMs and DEGs were mostly involved in beta-alanine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. The results of this study suggest that the addition of compound probiotics has a positive effect on intestinal metabolites, improving the growth performance and contributing to the overall health of broilers under heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) brings great challenges to the poultry industry. Vitamin B6 (VB6) is an essential micro-nutrient for animals to maintain normal physiological functions and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to explore the effect of VB6 on alleviating HS-induced intestinal barrier impairment in broilers. A total of 250 broilers (609.76 ± 0.34 g) were randomly allocated to 5 groups with 5 replicate cages of 10 birds each. The broilers in thermoneutral (TN) group were raised in thermoneutral conditions (23 ± 1°C) and fed with a basal diet. The birds in other four groups were housed under cycle high temperature (34 ± 1°C for 8 h/d) from d 21 to 35 and fed with the basal diet (HS group) or basal diet supplemented with 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg VB6 (HB-6, HB-12, HB-24 groups). The results showed that HS reduced the growth performance, increased ileum inflammatory cytokines levels, and impaired the gut barrier function (P < 0.05). Compared to the HS group, final body weight, average daily gain, and average daily feed intake, and the feed conversion ratio were improved by VB6 supplementation. The diamine oxidase, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-18, IL-10, and interferon-γ levels were reduced by VB6 supplementation (P < 0.05). Moreover, VB6 supplementation linearly or quadratically enhanced villus height and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio of duodenum and jejunum, and decreased crypt depth of duodenum and ileum. The mRNA expression of Occlaudin, ZO1, Mucin2, Mucin4, E-cadhein, and β-catenin were increased by VB6 treatment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, dietary VB6 altered the diversity and community of gut microbiota (P < 0.05). A total of 83 differential metabolites associated with the amelioration of VB6 were identified, which were primarily enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, caffeine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism pathway. Collectively, VB6 may improve the growth performance and intestinal barrier function of heat-stressed broilers by regulating the ileal microbiota and metabolic homeostasis.",

A total of 240, 22-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were divided into 4 groups. The control group was housed at 23.0 ± 0.61°C and fed with basal diet, while the 3 heat-stressed groups (A, B, and C groups) were housed at 30.5 ± 0.69°C and fed with basal diet containing 0, 100, and 200 mg/kg phloretin, respectively.

    "abstract": "1. The influence of glucose oxidase (GOD) supplementation on growth, gut inflammation and its compensatory effects in broilers was investigated before and after heat stress.2. Before heat stress, one-day-old broilers were divided into two groups: the control (CON) and GOD (100 g/t complete feed) groups. On d 21, the CON group was equally divided into CON1 and CON2 groups, and heat stress (35°C) was applied to the CON2 and GOD groups for 8 h/day to the end of the study, d 27 of age. The chickens were either killed before heat stress and 2 d after heat stress for the determination of cytokines in the liver and ileum, serum antioxidant enzymes and ileal microbiota. Growth performance was determined before and 7 d after heat stress.3. The GOD decreased Clostridiales and Enterobacteriaceae families of bacteria and increased ileal nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β, and interferon-γ (P < 0.05) before heat stress. The broilers exhibited compensatory effects, including increases in ileal sirtuin-1, heat shock protein 70 expression, liver nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 content, serum total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase level (P < 0.05). At 2 d after heat stress, inflammatory factors were increased in both the CON2 and GOD groups, but the levels were lower in the GOD than CON2 (P < 0.05). On d 7 after heat stress, GOS alleviated heat stress induced growth retardation (P < 0.05).4. These data suggested that GOD supplementation in broiler diets before heat stress stimulated intestinal oxidative stress and produced a compensatory response, which prevented a rapid increase in intestinal inflammatory factors and helped to maintain growth performance under heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) is one of the most important threats for the current poultry industry. Therefore, many efforts have been made to ameliorate the adverse effect of HS on poultry production; however, physiological and molecular mechanisms pertaining to HS are still limited in poultry. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to investigate functional alterations based on individual and integrated transcriptomes in the liver and jejunal mucosa tissues of broiler chickens exposed to HS conditions. Broiler chickens exposed to HS showed decreased growth performance and increased corticosterone concentrations in the feather. In the transcriptome analysis, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the liver and jejunal mucosa by HS conditions. In the liver, genes related to amino acid oxidation, tryptophan metabolism, lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and immune responses were altered by HS, which support the reason why heat-stressed poultry had decreased productive performance. In the jejunal mucosa, genes related to defense systems, glutathione metabolism, detoxification of xenobiotics, and immune responses were differently expressed by HS conditions. The integrated transcriptome analysis with DEGs found in the liver and jejunal mucosa showed a considerable connectivity between the core nodes in the constructed networks, which includes glutathione metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism, carbon metabolism, and several amino acid metabolisms. The core network analysis may indicate that increased requirement of energy and amino acids in the jejunal mucosa of broiler chickens exposed to HS conditions is likely compromised by increased oxidation and synthesis of amino acids in the liver. Therefore, our results may provide comprehensive insights for molecular and metabolic alterations of broiler chickens raised under HS conditions, which can aid in the development of the novel strategies to ameliorate the negative effect of HS on poultry productivity and health.",

Broilers in heat stress groups exposed 8 h/day heat stress (35 ± 2°C) for 7 or 14 consecutive days, and the rest of time per day were kept at 23 ± 2℃ the same as control group broilers. Growth performance and the liver tissues were collected for histological observation and detection of organ index and liver redox status. The serum indicators (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) related to liver injury were determined. Moreover, Nrf2-related genes and protein expression levels in liver were measured. The results showed that in heat stress group broilers the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, liver weight, and liver index were decreased, inflammatory cells infiltration in liver, and serum AST level was enhanced, compared with control group broilers. Moreover, the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) level were increased after 1 wk of heat stress. Nrf2, Sqstm1/p62, HO-1, and NQO1 mRNA expressions in the liver of broilers were decreased by heat stress. P62 and p-p62 protein expressions were significantly up-regulated, but Nrf2 and keap1 protein level was decreased in heat stress group broilers as compared to control group. The mRNA expression levels of Beclin1, LC3-I, LC3-II were down-regulated significantly with heat stress for 1 wk. The mRNA expression level of mTOR up-regulated after 2 wk of heat stress.

Five birds per treatment at 1 and 12 days post-HS were euthanized, and the liver and P. major muscle were sampled. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity as well as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), advanced glycation end product (AGE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl (PCO) were analyzed as biomarkers for DNA, carbohydrate, lipid, and protein oxidation, respectively. The SOD, CAT, and GSH-GPx activity levels in the liver and the P. major muscle changed under HS; however, some of the changes were tissue-specific or dependent on the duration of the HS. There were increased liver 8-OHdG during chronic HS and also increased liver AGE levels during both acute and chronic HS indicating significant carbohydrate and DNA oxidations. In the P. major muscle, we observed significant increases in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation which may reflect that this tissue is less resilient to oxidative damage under heat stress. We show that heat stress caused tissue-specific changes to levels of oxidation biomarkers in chicken.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Chronic heat stress has detrimental effects on the growth performance of broilers, and the potential mechanism is under exploration. In this study, the protein carbonyl modification was introduced to glycolytic enzymes to evaluate its relationship with the growth performance of heat-stressed (HS) broilers. A total of 144 male 28-day-old broilers were assigned to 3 treatments: the normal control group (NC, raised at 22°C with free access to feed and water), the HS group (raised at 32°C with free access to feed and water), and the pair-fed group (PF, raised at 22°C with an amount of feed equal to that consumed by the HS group on a previous day). Results showed that heat stress decreased the average daily growth, increased the feed-to-gain ratio (F/G), decreased breast muscle rate, and increased abdominal fat rate compared with the NC and PF groups (P < 0.05). Higher cloacal temperature and serum creatine kinase activity were found in the HS group than those of the NC and PF groups (P < 0.05). Heat stress increased the contents of carbonyl, advanced glycation end-products, malonaldehyde, and the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity compared with the NC and PF groups (P < 0.05). Heat stress increased the contents of glucose and lactate, declined the glycogen content, and lowered the relative protein expressions of pyruvate kinase muscle type, lactate dehydrogenase A type (LDHA), and citrate synthase compared to those of the NC group (P < 0.05). In contrast to the NC and PF groups, heat stress intensified the carbonylation levels of phosphoglucomutase 1, triosephosphate isomerase 1, β-enolase, and LDHA, which were positively correlated with the F/G (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that heat stress depresses growth performance on account of oxidative stress and glycolysis disorders. It further increases the carbonylation of glycolytic enzymes, which potentially correlates with the F/G by disturbing the mode of energy supply of broilers.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the dietary addition of <i>Spirulina platensis</i> (SP) and/or garlic powder (GP) on heat-stressed broiler chickens. For this purpose, 600 Ross-308 broiler chicks were allocated at 22 days of age into five groups (G1-G5), each comprising six groups of 20 birds each. Chickens kept in G1 (negative control) were fed a basal diet and raised at 26 ± 1 °C. Chickens kept in G2 to G5 were exposed to periodic heat stress (35 ± 1 °C for 9 h/day) from 22 to 35 days old. Chickens in G2 (positive control) were provided a basal diet, while G3, G4, and G5 were fed a basal diet enriched with SP (1 g/kg diet), GP (200 mg/kg diet), or SP/GP (1 g SP/kg + 200 mg GP/kg diet), respectively. The assessment parameters included the chickens' performance, malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity, blood biochemistry, intestinal morphology, and modulation of lactobacilli and total coliforms in the intestinal microbiota. Our findings demonstrated that supplementing heat-stressed chickens with SP and/or GP significantly mitigated the negative effects on the European production efficiency index (EPEF), survival rate, cholesterol profile, and oxidative stress markers. Chickens supplemented with GP and/or SP exhibited significantly better EPEF and survivability rates. Heat stress had a significant impact on both the gut structure and gut microbiota. However, SP and/or GP supplementation improved the gut morphology, significantly increased the intestinal lactobacilli, and reduced the coliform contents. It was also found that the simultaneous feeding of SP and GP led to even higher recovery levels with improved lipid metabolites, immunity, and oxidative status. Overall, supplementing chickens with SP and/or GP can alleviate the negative effects of heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Essential oils (EO) affect performance, intestinal integrity, bone mineralization, and meat quality in broiler chickens subjected to cyclic heat stress (HS). Day-of-hatch Cobb 500 male broiler chicks (<i>n</i> = 475) were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1: No heat stress (Thermoneutral) + control diets with no antibiotics; Group 2: heat stress control + control diets; Group 3: heat stress + control diets supplemented with thymol chemotype (45 ppm) and herbal betaine (150 ppm) formulation EO1; Group 4: heat stress + control diets supplemented with phellandrene (45 ppm) and herbal betaine (150 ppm) formulation EO2. From day 10-42, the heat stress groups were exposed to cyclic HS at 35°C for 12 h (8:00-20:00). BW, BWG, FI, and FCRc were measured at d 0, 10, 28, and 42. Chickens were orally gavaged with FITC-d on days 10 (before heat stress) and 42. Morphometric analysis of duodenum and ileum samples and bone mineralization of tibias were done. Meat quality was assessed on day 43 with ten chickens per pen per treatment. Heat stress reduced BW by day 28 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to thermoneutral chickens. At the end of the trial, chickens that received both formulations of EO1 and EO2 had significantly higher BW than HS control chickens. A similar trend was observed for BWG. FCRc was impaired by EO2 supplementation. There was a significant increase in total mortality in EO2 compared with EO1 EO1 chickens had lower FITC-d concentrations at day 42 than the HS control. In addition, EO1 treatment is not statistically different if compared to EO2 and thermoneutral. Control HS broilers had significantly lower tibia breaking strength and total ash at day 42 than heat-stressed chickens supplemented with EO1 and EO2. Heat stress affected intestinal morphology more than thermoneutral chickens. EO1 and EO2 improved intestinal morphology in heat-stressed chickens. Woody breast and white striping were more common in thermoneutral chickens than heat stress chickens. In conclusion, the EO-containing diet could improve broiler chicken growth during cyclic heat stress, becoming increasingly relevant in antibiotic-free production in harsh climates.",

    "title": "Early Feeding Strategy Mitigates Major Physiological Dynamics Altered by Heat Stress in Broilers.",
    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Heat stress is one of the stressors that negatively affect broiler chickens, leading to a reduction in production efficiency and profitability. This reduction affects the economy in general, especially in hot and semi-hot countries. Therefore, improving heat tolerance of broiler chicks is a key to sustained peak performance, especially under adverse environmental heat stress conditions. The present study investigated three early feed withdrawal regimes (FWD) as a potential mitigation for thermal stress exposure. A total of 240 unsexed one-day-old Cobb-500 chicks were randomly recruited to one of four experimental groups using a completely randomized design (10 birds × 6 replicates). The experimental groups included the control group with no feed withdrawal (control), while the other three groups were subjected to early feed withdrawal for either 24 h on the 5th day of age (FWD-24), 12 h on the 3rd and 5th day of age (FWD-12), or 8 h on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th day of age (FWD-8), respectively. Production performance was monitored throughout the experiment. Meanwhile, blood and liver samples were taken at the end of the experimental period to evaluate major physiological dynamic changes. Our findings demonstrated that under chronic heat stress conditions, FWD treatments significantly improved broilers' production performance and enhanced several physiological parameters compared with the control. Serum levels of thyroid hormones were elevated, whereas leptin hormone was decreased in FWD groups compared with the control. Moreover, serum total protein, globulin, and hemoglobin levels were higher, while total cholesterol and uric acid were lower in the FWD groups. Furthermore, FWD groups showed significantly higher antioxidant marker activity with a significantly lower lipid peroxidation level. Immunoglobulin levels, lysozyme, complement factor C3, and liver heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) concentration were also elevated in FWD compared with the control. Also, serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) significantly increased with FWD. Based on our findings, early feed withdrawal can be applied as a promising non-invasive nutritional strategy for broilers reared under chronic heat stress conditions. Such a strategy promotes the alleviation of the deleterious effects of heat stress on broiler performance, immunity, and redox status, owing to the onset of physiological adaptation and the development of thermotolerance ability.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Bile acids are critical for lipid absorption, however, their new roles in maintaining or regulating systemic metabolism are irreplaceable. The negative impacts of heat stress (HS) on growth performance, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant status have been reported, but it remains unknown whether the bile acids (BA) composition of broiler chickens can be affected by HS. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the modulating effects of the environment (HS) and whether dietary BA supplementation can benefit heat-stressed broiler chickens. A total of 216 Arbor Acres broilers were selected with a bodyweight approach average and treated with thermal neutral (TN), HS (32°C), or HS-BA (200 mg/kg BA supplementation) from 21 to 42 days. The results showed that an increase in average daily gain (<i>P</i> < 0.05) while GSH-Px activities (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in both serum and liver were restored to the normal range were observed in the HS-BA group. HS caused a drop in the primary BA (<i>P</i> = 0.084, 38.46%) and Tauro-conjugated BA (33.49%) in the ileum, meanwhile, the secondary BA in the liver and cecum were lower by 36.88 and 39.45% respectively. Notably, results were consistent that SBA levels were significantly increased in the serum (3-fold, <i>P</i> = 0.0003) and the ileum (24.89-fold, <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Among them, TUDCA levels (<i>P</i> < 0.01) were included. Besides, BA supplementation indeed increased significantly TUDCA (<i>P</i> = 0.0154) and THDCA (<i>P</i> = 0.0003) levels in the liver, while ileal TDCA (<i>P</i> = 0.0307), TLCA (<i>P</i> = 0.0453), HDCA (<i>P</i> = 0.0018), and THDCA (<i>P</i> = 0.0002) levels were also increased. Intestinal morphology of ileum was observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, birds fed with BA supplementation reduced (<i>P</i> = 0.0431) crypt depth, and the ratio of villous height to crypt depth trended higher (<i>P</i> = 0.0539) under the heat exposure. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that dietary supplementation with BA resulted in upregulation of <i>FXR</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0369), <i>ASBT</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0154), and <i>Keap-1</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0104) while downregulation of <i>iNOS</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.0399) expression in ileum. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and relevance networks revealed that HS-derived changes in gut microbiota and BA metabolites of broilers may affect their resistance to HS. Thus, BA supplementation can benefit broiler chickens during high ambient temperatures, serving as a new nutritional strategy against heat stress.",

This study aimed to investigate the impact of Zn-L-SeMet in broiler diets from 1 to 42 days of age reared under cyclic heat stress and its effects on growth performance, cloacal temperatures, mortality rate, blood parameters, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene expression in the breast muscle. A total of 1000 male Cobb 500® broiler chicks were randomly assigned to five treatments: 0, 0.15, 0.23, 0.47, and 1.30 mg/kg of Zn-L-SeMet. Each treatment consisted of 10 replicates with 20 birds each. No statistically significant differences in growth performance were observed from 1 to 21 days of age (P > 0.05). However, from 1 to 42 days, feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreased linearly (P < 0.05). Cloacal temperatures showed no significant effects (P > 0.05), while overall mortality rate exhibited a quadratic response (P < 0.05), with the optimal inclusion level predicted to reduce broiler mortality at 0.71 mg/kg. Triglyceride (TRG) levels increased with 0.97 mg/kg (P < 0.05), and gama-glutamil transferase (GGT) levels decreased with the inclusion of 1.19 mg/kg (P < 0.05). No significant effects on IGF-1 and GHR gene expression were found (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the inclusion of 1.30 mg/kg of Zn-L-SeMet in diets of heat-stressed broilers improved growth performance from 1 to 42 days of age. An inclusion of 0.71 mg/kg reduced mortality rate, while 0.97 mg and 1.19 mg increased and reduced TRG and GGT levels, respectively.",

Concurrently, it restored the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Furthermore, PCA maintained the jejunum function by increasing the levels of ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin. Mechanistically, PCA inhibited the activation of TLR4/p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways, thereby regulating the imbalance in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses caused by heat stress.",

This study evaluated the effects of vitamin E (Vit E) and organic selenium (Se) supplementation on performance, body composition, core body temperatures, and mRNA abundance of nutrient transporters in the jejunum of broilers exposed to daily 4-h elevated temperature during d 28 to 35. A total of 640 Cobb male birds were randomly allocated to 32 floor pens in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement that included ambient temperature (thermoneutral, [TN]; or heat stress, [HS]) and dietary treatments (basal diet or Vit E + Se). Four rooms were used (2 TN and 2 HS) each housing half of the 8 replicate pens per group. Vit E and organic Se were added to the basal diet at the rate of 250 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg diet, respectively. Data were subjected to a 2-way ANOVA using the GLM procedure of JMP (SAS). During the HS period, birds fed the Vit E/Se diet had significantly lower mortality compared to nonsupplemented group (1.92% vs. 7.01%). Moreover, dietary Vit E/Se supplementation had a significant effect on performance by increasing BWG, FI, and European production efficiency factor (EPEF) during the entire experimental period (d 0-35). Dietary Vit E and Se supplementation significantly increased carcass, tissue, lean, and fat weights as well as bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) on d 35. Birds fed Vit E/Se supplemented diet had significantly lower (P = 0.010) core body temperature compared to birds fed the basal diet on d 30. Dietary treatment did not influence mRNA abundance of PepT1, SGLT1, or NaPi-IIb on d 28 or d 35. However, HS significantly upregulated levels of PepT1 and NaPi-IIb (P < 0.001) and downregulated that of SGLT1 (P = 0.017) on d 28. In conclusion, dietary Vit E and Se supplementation significantly improved broiler growth performance and carcass composition, and reduced heat-related mortality and core body temperature (on d 30) without influencing the mRNA abundance of intestinal nutrient transporters.",

These birds were fed corn-soybean meal basal diet or the same diet supplemented with 3 % DTP (420 mg lycopene/kg diet) or 5 % (708 mg lycopene/kg diet) of DTP. Blood samples were collected on days 28 and 42, and the birds were slaughtered at the same times. Supplementation of 5 % of DTP increased body weight and production index and decreased feed conversion ratio during 1-28 days of age. On day 28, the broilers supplemented with 5 % DTP had lower serum triglycerides and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration than those on the other dietary treatments. The activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was lower in the broilers fed 5 % TP than those of the broilers fed other diets at 28 days of age. The effects of heat stress (HS) were impaired body weight, enhanced serum activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, and MDA concentration while reducing the activities of GPx and SOD. Dried tomato pomace supplementation did not influence growth performance under HS but ameliorated the negative effects of HS on the serum enzyme activities, GPx activity, and lipid peroxidation. Heat stress did not change the relative weights of the lymphoid organs but reduced the total and IgG titers for secondary antibody response to sheep red blood cells and titer against Newcastle disease virus and increased the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. The supplementation with 5 % of DTP completely alleviated the negative effects of HS on immune responses. The ash, Ca, and P contents of the tibia bone were decreased under HS. The ash and Ca contents of the tibia were not significantly different between thermoneutral and heat-stressed broilers supplemented with 5 % DTP. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of DTP, particularly 5 % DTP, to broiler diet attenuated the detrimental effects of HS on the activities of serum enzymes, oxidative status, immune response, and bone composition.",

    "abstract": "We examined the effects of oral administration of L-citrulline (L-Cit) on plasma metabolic hormones and biochemical profile in broilers. Food intake, water intake, and body temperature were also analyzed. After dual oral administration (20 mmol/head/administration) of L-Cit, broilers were exposed to a high ambient temperature (HT; 30 ± 1°C) chamber for 120 min. Oral administration of L-Cit reduced (p < .001) rectal temperature in broilers. Food intake was increased (p < .05) by heat stress, but it was reduced (p < .05) by L-Cit. Plasma levels of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which initially increased (p < .0001) due to heat stress, were reduced (p < .01) by oral administration of L-Cit. Plasma insulin levels were increased by heat exposure (p < .01) and oral L-Cit (p < .05). Heat stress caused a decline (p < .05) in plasma thyroxine. Plasma lactic acid (p < .05) and non-esterified fatty acids (p < .01) were increased in L-Cit-treated heat-exposed broilers. In conclusion, our results suggest that oral L-Cit can modulate plasma concentrations of major metabolic hormones and reduces food intake in broilers.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Recently, interest has increased in using bio-additives, herbs, and their extracts as feed additives because of their potential role in improving chick's health and productivity, especially during stress. Thus, our aim in this study is to examine whether nutritional supplementation (probiotics and clove essential oils) will help mitigate the negative effect of heat stress on the bird by modifying the microbial content, boosting immunity, oxidative status, metabolic, and growth. In this study, three hundred one-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were fed the following experimental diet: (CON) basal diet (control diet); (CEO) CON with clove essential oils (300 mg/kg); (PRO) CON with probiotics (2 g/kg); (PC) CON with probiotics and clove essential oils. Our results showed a significant improvement (P < 0.05) in body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, nutrient digestibility, and digestive enzymes activities in broilers fed on PC, CEO, and PRO compared to the control group. Moreover, a significant decrease was recorded in the abdominal fat content and an increase in the relative weight of bursa of Fabricius, and higher antibody levels against Newcastle disease virus, as well as, there was an increase (P < 0.05) in interleukin 10 (IL-10) in all treated groups. Meanwhile, there was a decrease in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in all supplemented groups compared with the control group. Serum triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein concentrations, and alanine aminotransferase activities were significantly lower in the treated groups. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels were elevated (P < 0.05) and the malondialdehyde level value significantly decreased in all supplemented groups. The treated groups enhanced the ileum structure by increasing Lactobacillus, decreasing E. coli, and improving the morphometrically (P < 0.05). This study strongly suggests that clove essential oil and probiotic mixture can be used as a feed supplement to reduce the effects of heat stress by improving the growth performance and enhancing immuno-antioxidant status, ileum morphometric, as well as modifying the microbial community structure of the ileum of broilers.",

    "abstract": "Global warming has become intensified and widespread, threatening the world with causing acute heatwaves that adversely affect poultry production and producers' profitability. Spirulina platensis is a precious and promising mitigating strategy to combat the detrimental impacts of heat stress due to its high contents of nutrients and bioactive components. The current study was designed to compare the incorporation impact of S. platensis powder or aqueous extract on the growth and physiological responses of heat-stressed broiler chicks. Six hundred 1-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks were allocated into five experimental groups with six replicates of 20 chicks each. The control group fed the basal diet without additives, SPP1 and SPP2 groups fed the basal diet with 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg S. platensis powder, respectively, while SPE1 and SPE2 groups received 1 ml/L and 2 ml/L S. platensis aqueous extract in the drinking water, respectively. All birds were exposed to cyclic heat stress (34 ± 2 °C for 12 h) for three successive days a week from day 10 to day 35. In vitro analysis showed that total phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity of S. platensis were remarkably decreased (P < 0.001) in the aqueous extract compared to the powder form. Body weight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P < 0.001) in all treated groups, while carcass yield and dressing percentage were increased only in SPP1 and SPP2. Feed and water intake and blood biochemical parameters were not affected. Both forms of S. platensis enhanced the lipid profile, redox status, and humoral immune response of heat-stressed chicks superior to the powder form. Conclusively, the powder form of S. platensis was more effective in enhancing the productivity of broilers and alleviating the negative impacts of heat stress than the aqueous extract form.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the effects of in ovo feeding of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and embryonic thermal manipulation (TM) on plasma biochemical parameters, organ weights, and hepatic gene expression in broilers exposed to cyclic heat stress (32 ± 1°C for 8 days) (HS) were investigated. A total of 175 chicks were assigned to five treatments: chicks hatched from control eggs (CON); chicks hatched from control eggs but exposed to HS (CON+HS); chicks hatched from eggs injected at 17.5 days of incubation with 0.6mL of 10% GABA and exposed to HS (G10+HS); chicks hatched from thermally manipulated eggs (39.6°C, 6h/d from embryonic days 10 to 18) and exposed to HS (TM+HS); chicks hatched from eggs that received both previous treatments during incubation and exposed to HS (G10+TM+HS). Results revealed that on day 36 post-hatch, hepatic NADPH oxidase 1 (P = 0.034) and 4 (P = 0.021) genes were downregulated in the TM+HS and G10+TM+HS compared to the CON+HS group. In addition, while acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene expression was reduced (P = 0.002) in the G10+TM group, gene expression of extracellular fatty acid-binding protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ was lower (P = 0.045) in the TM+HS group than in the CON+HS group. HS led to higher gene expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 90 (HSP90) (P = 0.005, and P = 0.022). On the other hand, the TM+HS group exhibited lower expression of both HSP70 (P = 0.031) and HSP90 (P = 0.043) whereas the G10+TM+HS group had a reduced (P = 0.016) HSP90 expression compared to the CON+HS. MANOVA on different gene sets highlighted an overall lower (P = 0.034) oxidative stress and lower (P = 0.035) heat shock protein expression in the G10+TM+HS group compared to the CON+HS group. Taken together, the current results suggest that the combination of in ovo feeding of GABA with TM can modulate HSPs and antioxidant-related gene expression in heat-stressed broilers.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Heat stress adversely affects the growth performance, muscle development, and protein metabolism in poultry. l-Citrulline (L-Cit), is a non-essential amino acid that is known to stimulate muscle protein synthesis under stress conditions. This study investigated whether L-Cit could influence the growth performance, amino acid profile, and protein metabolism in broilers exposed to high ambient temperature. In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, Arbor acre broilers (288 chickens) were fed with basal diet (CON) or 1% L-Cit supplemented diet and later subjected to either thermoneutral (TNZ: 24°C, 24 h/d) or heat stress (HS: 35°C for 8 h/d) environment for 21 days. The results showed that L-Cit diet promoted the body weight and body weight gain of broilers higher than the CON diet, and it further alleviated HS suppression of body weight and feed intake at certain periods (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Plasma urea, uric acid, glucose, and total cholesterol were elevated during HS, whereas, the triglyceride content was decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Serum amino acids including citrulline, alanine, aspartate, and taurine were decreased by HS. L-Cit supplementation restored the citrulline level and alleviated HS induction of 3-methylhistidine (<i>p</i> < 0.05). L-Cit supplementation increased the plasma growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration, as well as the GH concentration in the breast muscle (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The mRNA expression showed that HS elicited tissue-specific responses by upregulating some growth factors in the breast muscle, but downregulated the GH receptor, GH binding protein, and IGF-1 expression in the hypothalamus. L-Cit supplementation upregulated the GHRH and IGFBP2 expression in the hypothalamus. L-Cit also upregulated the expression of IGF-1R and IGFBP2 in the breast muscle of HS broilers. The total mTOR protein level in the breast muscle of HS broilers was also increased by L-Cit diet (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Therefore, this study demonstrated that HS negatively affected the growth performance of broilers and dysregulated the expression of growth factors related to protein metabolism. Contrarily, L-Cit promoted the growth responses of broilers <i>via</i> its stimulation of circulating GH/IGF-1 concentration. To certain extents, L-Cit supplementation elicited protective effects on the growth performance of HS broilers by diminishing protein catabolism.",

The dressing percentage, breast, leg, wing, heart, initial pH, color change, cooking loss (CL), water-holding capacity (WHC), shear force (SF), and texture profile with exception of springiness significantly affected by the treatments. The results showed that HS had negative effects on carcass weight and relative weights of the breast, spleen, and heart. Moreover, HS increased dressing percentage, wing, initial pH, final core temperature, initial lightness, WHC, and hardness. Significant differences in interactions between treatments and temperature were observed in the spleen, WHC, and SF. Water supplemented with BET effectively improved carcass dressing percentage, breast weight, and meat quality in terms of water-holding capacity and tenderness under HS conditions. More studies on the use of BET and/or MAGO at different levels were recommended.",

Dietary supplementation of arginine (Arg) and citrulline (Cit) might increase the performance of broilers raised under warm temperature due to vasodilation effects. This study investigated the effects of L-Arg or L-Cit supplementation in broilers fed a reduced protein wheat-based diet deficient in Arg under thermoneutral (NT) and cyclic warm temperature (WT). Ross 308 cockerels (<i>n =</i> 720) were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments with 12 replicates of 15 birds per pen from d 7 to 21. The 4 treatments were: normal protein (NP), i.e., 22.3% and 20.9% crude protein in grower and finisher, respectively; reduced protein (RP), i.e., 2.5% lower protein and deficient in Arg; and RP supplemented with 0.28% Arg (RP-Arg) or 0.28% Cit (RP-Cit). A factorial arrangement of treatments was applied during the finisher phase (21 to 35 d). Factors were: diet (4 diets above); and temperature, NT (24 °C) or cyclic WT (33 ± 1 °C for 6 h per day) with 6 replicate pens per treatment. During 7 to 35 d and 21 to 35 d, the birds fed the RP diet had lower body weight gain (BWG) and higher FCR compared to the NP diet (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The addition of Arg or Cit to RP decreased FCR compared to RP (<i>P</i> < 0.01). During 21 to 35 d, the birds exposed to WT had lower feed intake (FI), lower BWG (<i>P</i> < 0.001) but similar FCR (<i>P</i> > 0.05) compared to birds exposed to NT. Diet by temperature interactions were not observed for performance parameters during the period of WT (<i>P</i> > 0.05).

Here, we evaluated the effects of heat stress on the growth performance, antioxidant levels, and meat quality of broilers under different stocking densities. A total of 885 28-day-old male broilers (Ross 308) were subjected to five treatments (16, 18, 21, 23, and 26 birds/m2) and exposed to high temperatures (33 °C for 24 h) for 7 days. High stocking density (23 and 26 birds/m2) resulted in significantly decreased body weight (p < 0.01) and superoxide dismutase activity in the blood (p < 0.05) and increased (p < 0.05) rectal temperature and corticosterone. Additionally, the concentrations of heat shock protein 70 and malondialdehyde in the liver were higher in the 26 birds/m2 group (p < 0.05). Similarly, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of breast meat increased linearly as the stocking density increased (p < 0.05). There was increased shear force in breast meat at low stocking density (p < 0.01). Thus, lower stocking density can relieve oxidative stress induced by high temperatures in broilers and improve the antioxidant capacity and quality of breast meat during hot seasons.",

A total of 180 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were assigned randomly to one of 2×3 factorially arranged treatments: two housing temperatures (22°C for 24 h/d; thermoneutral, TN or 34°C for 8 h/d HS) and three dietary lycopene levels (0, 200, or 400 mg/kg). Each treatment consisted of three replicates of 10 birds. Birds were reared to 42 d of age. Heat stress caused reductions in feed intake and weight gain by 12.2 and 20.7% and increased feed efficiency by 10.8% (P<0.0001 for all). Increasing dietary lycopene level improved performance in both environments. Birds reared under the HS environment had lower serum and muscle lycopene concentration (0.34 vs. 0.50 μg/mL and 2.80 vs. 2.13 μg/g), activities of superoxide dismutase (151 vs. 126 U/mL and 131 vs. 155 U/mg protein), glutathione peroxidase (184 vs. 154 U/mL and 1.39 vs. 1.74 U/mg protein), and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration (0.53 vs. 0.83 μg/mL and 0.78 vs. 0.45 μg/ mg protein) than birds reared under the TN environment. Changes in levels of lycopene and MDA and activities of enzymes in serum and muscle varied by the environmental temperature as dietary lycopene level increased. Moreover, increasing dietary lycopene level suppressed muscle Keap1 expression and enhanced muscle Nrf2 expression, which had increased by 150% and decreased by 40%, respectively in response to HS. In conclusion, lycopene supplementation alleviates adverse effects of HS on performance through modulating expressions of stress-related nuclear transcription factors.",

Two hundred 38-day-old broilers were arranged in a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 (temperatures and sexes) factorial arrangement in five replicates. Broilers were raised at 24 ± 1 °C or 32 ± 1 °C for 3 days and returned to 24 °C for 2 days. The study showed that HS decreased both average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), serum total glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (T-SOD). However, it increased feed conversion ratio (FCR), rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), serum glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the protein carbonyl group (PCG). Male broilers had higher ADFI, ADG, lactic acid (LA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and PCG, but lower FCR, albumin, total antioxidant capacity, T-SOD, and GPx. Temperature and sex significantly interacted with ADFI, ADG, LA, and HDL-C. The effects of HS on RR, RT, glucose, albumin, BUN, PCG, T-SOD, and GPx recovered after 2 days. These results indicate that HS and subsequent recovery affect growth performance, which is accompanied by disturbances in serum nutrient metabolism and abnormalities in redox function and manifested by temporal and gender differences.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary SN at two different levels (2 and 4%) on the serum levels of cortisol and some selected parameters of broilers exposed to chronic heat stress. A total of 240 broiler chickens were randomly assigned to six dietary groups as follows: (1) control: fed the basal diet; (2) HS: heat-stressed broiler fed the basal diet; (3) HS-SN2: heat-stressed broiler fed 2% dietary SN; (4) HS-SN4: heat-stressed broilers fed 4% SN; (5) SN2: no heat-stressed broilers fed the basal diet supplemented with 2% SN; (6) SN4: no heat-stressed broilers fed the basal diet supplemented with 4% SN. Diet supplementation with SN was performed from days 14 to 35 and chronic heat stress was induced from days 22 to 29. The serum parameters were evaluated on days 14, 21, 29 and 35. HS had higher serum levels of cortisol, total cholesterol (TC), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase (CK) compared to the other treatments. HS-SN4 had significantly lower cortisol, TC, alanine aminotransferase and CK compared to HS and HS-SN2. The inclusion of 4% SN powder in the broilers' diet alleviated the negative effects of heat stress by decreasing cortisol, TC and tissue damage indices. It seems that dietary SN could be used as a feed additive in the poultry diet for improving the health status and defence mechanisms of the birds under stressful conditions.",

    "title": "N-acetyl-L-cysteine improves the performance of chronic cyclic heat-stressed finisher broilers but has no effect on tissue glutathione levels.",
    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "1. It was hypothesised that dietary N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in feed, as a source of cysteine, could improve the performance of heat-stressed finisher broilers by fostering glutathione (GSH) synthesis. GSH is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant for which the sulphur amino acid cysteine is rate limiting for its synthesis.2. In the first experiment, four levels of NAC: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg were added to a diet with a suboptimal level of sulphur amino acids in the finisher phase. In the second experiment, NAC was compared to other sulphur amino acid sources at equal molar amounts of digestible sulphur amino acids. Birds were allocated to four groups: control, 2000 mg/kg NAC, 1479 mg/kg L-cystine, and 2168 mg/kg Ca-salt of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid. A chronic cyclic heat stress model (temperature was increased to 34°C for 7 h daily) was initiated at 28 d of age.3. In the first experiment, growth performance and feed efficiency in the finisher phase were significantly improved by graded NAC. ADG was 88.9, 92.2, 93.7 and 97.7 g/d, and the feed-to-gain ratio was 2.18, 1.91, 1.85 and 1.81 for the 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg NAC treatments, respectively. However, liver and heart GSH levels were not affected by NAC. On d 29, liver gene transcript of <i>cystathionine-beta-synthase like</i> was reduced by NAC, which suggested reduced trans-sulphuration activity. The second experiment showed that L-cystine and Ca-salt of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid were more effective in improving performance than NAC.4. In conclusion, N-acetyl-L-cysteine improved dose-dependently growth and feed efficiency in heat-stressed finishing broilers. However, this was not associated with changes in tissue GSH levels, but more likely worked by sparing methionine and/or NAC's and cysteine's direct antioxidant properties.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of synbiotics supplementation on growth performance, antioxidant status, immune function, and intestinal barrier function in broilers subjected to cyclic heat stress. One hundred and forty-four 22-day-old male broilers were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups of six replicates each for a 21-day study, with eight birds per replicate. Broilers in the control group were reared at a thermoneutral temperature and received a basal diet. Broilers in the other two heat-stressed groups were fed a basal diet supplemented without (heat-stressed group) and with 1.5 g/kg synbiotic (synbiotic group). One and a half gram of the synbiotic consisted with 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units (CFU) Clostridium butyricum, 1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU Bacillus licheniformis, 4.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU Bacillus subtilis, 600 mg yeast cell wall, and 150 mg xylooligosaccharide. Compared with the control group, heat stress increased rectal temperatures at 28, 35, and 42 days of age, respectively (P < 0.05). Birds subjected to heat stress had reduced weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency during 22 to 42 days (P < 0.05). In contrast, supplementation with the synbiotic decreased rectal temperature at 42 days of age and elevated weight gain of heat stress-challenged broilers (P < 0.05). Heat-stressed broilers exhibited a lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in jejunal mucosa and a higher malondialdehyde accumulation in serum, liver and jejunal mucosa (P < 0.05), and the regressive SOD activity was normalized to control level when supplementing synbiotic (P < 0.05). Heat stress increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels in serum and IL-1β content in jejunal mucosa of broilers (P < 0.05). Synbiotic reduced IL-1β level in serum of broilers subjected to heat stress (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, elevated serum diamine oxidase activity and reduced jejunal villus height were observed in broilers of the heat-stressed group (P < 0.05), and the values of these two parameters in the synbiotic group were intermediate (P > 0.05). Heat stress upregulated mRNA abundance of IL-1β and IFN-γ and downregulated gene expression levels of occluding and zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) in jejunal mucosa of broilers (P < 0.05). The alterations in the mRNA expression levels of jejunal IL-1β and ZO-1 were reversed by the synbiotic (P > 0.05). In conclusion, dietary synbiotics could improve growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immune function, and intestinal barrier function in heat-stressed broilers.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "The study investigated resveratrol's effect on growth performance, intestinal development, and antioxidant capacity of broilers subjected to heat stress (HS). A total of 162 21-day-old male AA broilers were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups with 6 replicates of 9 birds each. The 3 treatment groups were as follows: the control (CON), in which broilers were housed at 22 ± 1 °C for 24 h day<sup>-1</sup>, and the HS and HS + resveratrol (400 mg/kg) groups, in which broilers were housed at 33 ± 1 °C for 10 h a day from 8:00 to 18:00 and 22 ± 1 °C for rest of the time. Results indicated that birds in the HS group exhibited lower (<i>p</i> < 0.05) final body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) compared with birds in the CON group. HS birds also had lower (<i>p</i> < 0.05) relative jejunum weight, relative ileum and jejunum length, jejunal villus height, and villus height to crypt depth ratios than the CON group. The activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the mRNA levels of NF-E2-related factor 2 (<i>Nrf2</i>), <i>SOD1</i>, and <i>GPX</i> were also lower (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the HS than CON group. The HS group had higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) protein carbonyl (PC) contents and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (<i>Keap1</i>) mRNA levels. Compared with HS group, the HS + resveratrol group exhibited higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) BW and ADG, relative jejunum weight, relative length of ileum, jejunal villus height, activities of GPX and GST, and mRNA levels of <i>Nrf2</i> and <i>SOD1</i>, but they had lower (<i>p</i> < 0.05) PC content and <i>Keap1</i> mRNA levels. In conclusion, resveratrol can improve the intestinal development and antioxidant function of broilers under HS, and therefore improve growth performance. The mechanism by which resveratrol enhances the intestinal antioxidant capacity is mediated by Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate potential hormonal mechanisms associated with the stress response, thermoregulation, and metabolic changes of broiler chickens exposed to high environmental temperature. Nine hundred 1-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 708) were placed in floor pens and raised to 24 d. At 24 d, chicks were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments, heat stress (HS) or no HS, and allocated into battery cages in 8 batteries (10 birds per cage, 2 cages per battery). On day 31, blood was collected prior to HS and analyzed using an iSTAT analyzer. Half of the batteries were then moved into 2 rooms with an elevated ambient temperature (35°C) for 8 h. The remaining batteries stayed in the thermoneutral rooms with an ambient temperature of 22°C. Beginning at 5 h after the initiation of HS, blood was collected and analyzed using an iSTAT analyzer, birds were euthanized, and hypothalamus and pituitary samples were collected (16 birds per treatment), flash frozen, and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to compare mRNA levels of key corticotropic and thyrotrophic genes in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Levels of mRNA for each target gene were normalized to PGK1 (pituitary) and GAPDH (hypothalamus) mRNA. Differences were determined using mixed model ANOVA. HS decreased (P < 0.05) feed intake, BW, bicarbonate, potassium, CO<sub>2</sub>, and triiodothyronine, while it increased mortality, glucose, pH, plasma thyroxine, and corticosterone. Expression of pituitary corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 was downregulated (P < 0.001), while corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 mRNA levels were higher (P = 0.001) in HS birds. HS increased expression of thyroid hormone receptor β (P = 0.01) (2.8-fold) and thyroid stimulating hormone β (P = 0.009) (1.4-fold). HS did not affect levels of mRNA of genes evaluated in the hypothalamus. Results showed that HS significantly affected both the thyrotropic and corticotropic axes. Understanding the role and regulation of these pathways during HS will allow researchers to better evaluate management strategies to combat HS.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress causes lipid peroxidation in poultry, necessitating antioxidant administration. The experiment evaluated the modulating effects of betaine and ascorbic acid (AA) on indoor behavior and some performance parameters of broiler chickens during the hot-dry season. Experimental groups were: Group I (control) was daily given sterile water; Group II, betaine at 250 mg/kg; Group III, AA (50 mg/kg), and Group IV, betaine (250 mg/kg) + AA (50 mg/kg), orally for 42 days. The natural occurring dry-bulb temperature (28.0-37.0 °C), relative humidity (69.0-93.0%), and temperature-humidity index (27.9-36.1 °C) were predominantly outside the thermo-neutral zone for broiler chickens, indicating heat stress conditions. Scan test, used to assess the percentage of birds sitting/lying, panting, feeding, drinking and spreading wings, was performed at 06:00 h, 13:00 h and 18:00 h on each of days 35 and 42. Feed intakes (FD), water consumption (WC), body weight, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed-to-gain ratio (FGR) were obtained. Betaine+AA reduced (P < 0.05) percentage of birds panting; AA decreased (P < 0.05) percentage of birds spreading wing, compared with control. Finisher phase: betaine and/or AA, decreased FGR, increased ADG (P < 0.05); betaine reduced (P < 0.01) FD compared with control. Grower phase: betaine, either alone or with AA, lowered FGR and FD (P < 0.01); AA reduced (P < 0.01) FD, compared with control.

Betaine administration decreased (P < 0.05) FD at 4 week-old, but its administration, either alone or with AA, reduced WC at 1 week-old, compared with control. Overall, betaine and/or AA group lowered FGR compared with controls.

A total of 162 yellow feather broilers that were 42 d of age were selected and randomly divided into three groups: the control group (CONT, CP 16%), heat stress group (HS, CP 16%), and heat stress with low protein and high amino acid group (HS_LP, CP 14.5%). Following 14 d heating stress period, the HS_LP group showed no significant effect on production performance compared with the HS group. After a 28 d feeding trial, compared with the HS group, the HS_LP group significantly reduced feed: gain at 15-28 d (P < 0.05), had a tendency to reduce feed: gain at 1-28 d (P = 0.056). Compared with the HS group, the serum catalase enzyme activity tended to be higher (P = 0.067), and liver glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the HS_LP group. Other antioxidant capacity indexes were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Duodenum (P < 0.05) and ileum (P < 0.05) villus height were significantly increased, duodenum villus height: crypt depth ratio (P < 0.05) and jejunum crypt depth (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased, and jejunum villus height was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in broilers fed the HS_LP diet.

Moreover, constant chronic heat stress showed negative effects on serum biochemistry and the intestinal microbiota, increased antioxidant activity in both the plasma and breast meat, and increased counts of the pathogenic microorganisms in the small intestine. On the other hand, dietary CEO supplementation positively affected these parameters. CEO had a slight effect on performance, carcass characteristics, mortality rate and the incidence of footpad lesions. When compared to the control group, it was determined that CEO generally had a positive effect on lipid peroxidation in the plasma and tissues and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of in ovo feeding cysteine, lysine or their combinations on the perinatal and post-hatch physiological responses of broiler embryos exposed to heat stress during incubation. A total of two thousand fertile eggs of broiler breeders (Ross 308) flock (at 38 weeks of age) were used for this study. In the first 10 days, the eggs were incubated using the conventional protocol of relative humidity and temperature of 55% and 37.8°C respectively. From day ten onward, the temperature was increased to 39.6°C for 6 h per day. On day 17.5, 1,500 eggs with the evidence of living embryos were randomly selected and assigned to 6 treatments having five replicates of 50 eggs each. The treatments were: un-injected eggs (UI), eggs injected with only 0.5 ml distilled water (DW), 3.5 mg/egg cysteine (CY), 2mg/egg lysine (LY), 3.4 mg cysteine+2 mg lysine (CLH) and 1.7 mg cysteine+1 mg lysine (CLL). On day 21, the hatchability, anatomical characteristics, chick quality and the antioxidant status of the chicks were evaluated. During the post-hatch phase, data were collected on the haematology, biochemical parameters, growth performance and intestinal morphology of the birds. The results revealed that the hatchability of CY chicks was higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) than in the other treatments, while the lowest values were recorded in CLH. The hatching muscle of the chicks of CLL was similar to those of CY but higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) than the others. The MDA of DW and UI chickens was similar and higher than birds in the other treatment groups. The serum SOD of CLL birds was comparable to that of CY but higher than the values recorded in the other treatments. The final weights of CLL chickens were similar to those of LY but significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) than those of the other treatments. The duodenal villus heights of the birds of CLL were higher than those of the other treatment groups, whereas the villus height of the birds of CLH was higher than those of UI, DW and CY.

The broiler chickens in the control group were raised in the room (21 ± 1 °C) and fed with a finisher diet for 21 days. The broiler chickens of the HS group and the HS + DI groups were raised in the room (32 ± 1 °C for 8 h/day) and fed with a finisher diet containing DI at 0, 50, 150, and 200 mg/kg diet for 21 days. The results showed that HS-induced decreases in the final body weight (P < 0.01), average daily gain (P < 0.01), and average daily feed intake (P < 0.01) were alleviated by dietary supplementation of DI (P < 0.05). In addition, dietary supplementation of DI attenuated the increases in the liver index (P < 0.01) and abdominal fat rate (P < 0.01) caused by HS in broilers (P < 0.05). Treatment with DI ameliorated HS-induced lipid accumulation in the liver and serum of broiler chickens (P < 0.05). The upregulation of mRNA levels of fat synthesis factors (P < 0.01) and downregulation of mRNA levels of lipolysis-related factors (P < 0.01) caused by HS were markedly blunted after treatment with DI in the liver of broilers (P < 0.05). Broilers exposed to HS exhibited lower phosphorylated protein levels of AMP-activated protein kinase α and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α compared to the control group (P < 0.01), which were improved by treatment with DI (P < 0.01). Collectively, these results demonstrated that dietary supplementation of DI protects against chronic HS-induced growth performance impairment and lipid metabolism disorder in broiler chickens. These results not only provide a theoretical basis for DI to alleviate metabolic disorders but also provide a reference value for DI as a feed additive to improve heat stress in poultry caused by high temperature.",

A total of 400 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly assigned to 2 × 5 factorially arranged treatments: two temperature-controlled rooms (thermoneutral-TN or heat stress-HS for 8 h/day) and five dietary PO levels (0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 g/kg diet) for 42 days. Each treatment consisted of eight replicates of five birds. The results showed that HS increased glucose (<i>p</i> = 0.006), triglycerides (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and HDL (<i>p</i> = 0.042) at 21 days and reduced (<i>p</i> = 0.005) serum total cholesterol at 42 days. The results also showed that HS increased the contents of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). In contrast, PO linearly decreased AST (<i>p</i> = 0.048) and ALT (<i>p</i> = 0.020) at 21 and 42 days, respectively. The heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the birds under HS was higher than in those in the TN environment (<i>p</i> = 0.046). Heat stress decreased (<i>p</i> = 0.032) the relative weight of their livers at 21 days. The superoxide dismutase activity increased (<i>p</i> = 0.010) in the HS treatments in comparison to the TN treatments, while the glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.001) at 42 days; however, the activity of catalase had no significant effects. Meanwhile, increasing the dietary PO levels linearly decreased plasma malondialdehyde (<i>p</i> < 0.001) in the birds in the HS environment. In addition, PO reduced (<i>p</i> = 0.027) the expression of Hsp 70 in the liver by 92% when compared to the TN treatment without PO, mainly at the 6.0 g/kg diet level. The expression of Nrf2 was upregulated by 37% (<i>p</i> = 0.049) in response to PO with the 6.0 g/kg diet compared to the HS treatment without PO.

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "To investigate the change in zinc homeostasis of broilers under heat stress, 512 broiler chickens were raised to the age of 28 days. The broilers were then assigned to heat stress and normal temperature (36.0°C vs. 26.0°C) groups for 7 days. The results showed that oxidative stress induced by high temperature had a negative effect on the growth performance of broilers. Heat stress altered zinc homeostasis and led to a redistribution of zinc in broilers, which was reflected in increased zinc concentrations in the jejunum, liver, and tibia. Upregulation of the expression of the zinc exporter <i>ZnT1</i> and importers <i>ZIP8</i> and <i>ZIP14</i> in the jejunum indicated that more zinc was absorbed and transported from the jejunum into the blood, while the liver increased its capacity to hold zinc through upregulation of metallothionein (<i>MT</i>) expression, which was achieved by reducing <i>ZnT1</i> expression and upregulating the expression of the importer <i>ZIP3</i>. The pathway was mediated by zinc transporters, but the capacity of <i>MT</i> to chelate and release zinc ions also played a crucial role. The mechanism of alterations in zinc homeostasis under heat stress was revealed by the changes in zinc transporters and <i>MT</i> levels in the intestine and liver. Heat stress also altered cecal microbial diversity and reduced the relative abundances of <i>Bilophila</i> and <i>Dialister</i>. In conclusion, broilers altered systemic zinc homeostasis through the regulation of zinc transporters and <i>MT</i> in the liver and jejunum to resist oxidative stress induced by high temperature.",

On the 14th day of incubation (DOI) each of the two main groups was randomly divided into two equal subgroups; the control one was left under the appropriate incubation settings (TC<sub>0</sub>) whereas the other received prenatal heat conditioning (TC<sub>1</sub>) at 39.5 <sup>○</sup>C ± 0.1 for 6 h/d from the 14th to the 18th embryonic day (E), resulting finally in four experimental subgroups (S<sub>0</sub>TC<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>1</sub>TC<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>0</sub>TC<sub>1</sub> & S<sub>1</sub>TC<sub>1</sub>). RESULTS: showed that SPIDES treatment improved the hatchability of the stored eggs by almost 20% compared to untreated eggs. A combination of SPIDES and TC (S<sub>1</sub>TC<sub>1</sub>) increased significantly the levels of Immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) production at hatch and heat-stressed birds. Our findings revealed that the hepatic heat shock proteins (hsp70, 90 A,90 B, 60 and hspA9), antioxidants-related genes (CAT, and SOD2), and NADPH4 were significantly downregulated in the thermally conditioned group that challenged with thermal stress conditions. As opposed to that, the SPIDES group showed a significant increase in hepatic heat shock proteins, antioxidants-related genes, and NADPH4 when subjected to thermal-stress conditions. In conclusion, the combination of SPIDES and TC has a positive effect on some pre and post-hatch traits of broiler chicks. Under heat stress challenge, thermal conditioning can modify the expression of antioxidant-related genes and Hsps, leading to the enhanced acquisition of thermotolerance as evidenced by lower expression of Hsps and NADPH4. While SPIDES does not have a significant role in thermotolerance acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Natural feed additives play an important role in poultry production due to their safety and potential properties as an antioxidant and antimicrobial, as well as a growth stimulant. The present research was designed to assess the influence of dietary supplementation of either garlic, lemon essential oil, or their mixture on performance, nutrient digestibility, plasma constituents, immunity, and oxidative status, as well as intestinal development assessed by microbiota-histomorphology development in broilers under environmental heat stress. A total of 480 broiler chicks (Ross 308) at one-day-old were randomly divided into four groups (120 chicks/ group). The control group received the basal diet (CON), while the other three groups received the basal diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg garlic essential oil (GEO), 200 mg/kg lemon essential oil (LEO), and their mixture (GLO) 200 mg/kg diet, respectively for 35 days. The obtained results revealed that broilers fed essential oils as a mixture or individually had an improvement in average body weight, feed conversion ratio, carcass dressing, and an increase in digestive enzymes activities compared to the control group, furthermore, there was a reduction in the mortality rate and abdominal fat content. Adding essential oils as a mixture or individually led to a decrease in (P < 0.05) blood plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein. Broilers fed diets supplemented with essential oils as a mixture or individually had higher values of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase; while plasma malondialdehyde was lower (P < 0.05) compared to the control diet. Moreover, there was a significant enhancement in intestinal microbial content, and intestinal histological status of chickens fed with essential oils. Conclusively, including the mixture of essential oils improved performance, nutrient digestibility, and digestive enzymes activities. It also enhanced immunity, antioxidant state, and lipid profile, and gut microbiota- histomorphology in broilers. It was proposed that the broilers diet be supplemented with a mixture of essential oils to a mitigation of the effects of heat stress.",

    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria are responsible for roughly 90% of the ATP produced in a cell. A consequence of aerobic metabolism is oxidative stress that results from production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inefficiency of electron transport. Several antioxidant-redox coupled reactions in the mitochondria help minimize oxidative damage in the mitochondria. These redox reactions not only protect mitochondria from oxidative damage but also are important in regulating cellular redox status. Oxidative stress from mitochondrial ROS occurs in broilers in pulmonary hypertension syndrome, heat stress, and in the phenotypic expression of feed efficiency. Low levels of mitochondrial ROS are now recognized to play important roles in signal transduction mechanisms. A topology of ROS production has been reported that indicates that ROS derived from Complex I primarily cause oxidative damage, whereas ROS generated from Complex III are primarily involved in cell signaling. Reverse electron transport, once considered an artifact of in vitro conditions, now plays significant roles in physiological conditions including inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, muscle differentiation, and energy utilization. Understanding the balancing act that mitochondria play in health and disease will continue to be vital biological component of improving efficiency in animal production.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Methyl sulfonyl methane (MSM) is available as a dietary supplement for human and has been associated with multiple health benefits such as reduction of oxidative stress. Heat stress (HS) is an environmental stressor challenging poultry production and known to inflict oxidative stress. We hypothesized that dietary MSM could attenuate HS-induced detrimental effects in broilers mediated by enhancement of antioxidant defenses. Hence, seven hundred ninety-two 1-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were allocated to 3 dietary treatments composed of corn-soybean meal diets with 0 (Ctrl), 1, or 2 g/kg MSM, with 12 replicates (22 birds each) per treatment for 39 d and subjected to a chronic cyclic HS model (temperature of 34°C and 52-58% relative humidity for 6 h daily) from d 24 to 39. MSM at 1 and 2 g/kg linearly increased daily gain and decreased feed-to-gain ratio compared with Ctrl in the grower phase (d 10-21, both P < 0.05). In the finisher phase (d 21-39) none of the performance and carcass indices were affected by treatment (P > 0.05). Nonetheless, data suggest reduced mortality by feeding MSM during HS. Also, during HS the diets with graded levels of MSM resulted in reduced rectal temperatures (P < 0.05) along with linearly decreased panting frequency on d 24 (P < 0.05). MSM supplemented birds showed a trend for linearly decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances of breast meat upon simulated retail display (P = 0.078). In addition, MSM administration linearly decreased lipid oxidation in plasma (d 25 and 39, P < 0.05) and breast muscle at d 23 (P < 0.05), concomitantly with linearly increased glutathione levels in erythrocytes (d 23 and 39, P < 0.05; d 25, P < 0.1) and breast muscle (d 23, P < 0.05; d 39, P < 0.1). In conclusion, MSM increased growth performance of broilers during grower phase, and exhibited positive effects on heat tolerance mediated by improved antioxidant capacity in broilers resulting in lower mortality in finisher phase.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Heat stress significantly undermines the poultry industry by escalating rates of morbidity and mortality and impairing growth performance. Our recent findings indicate that Prinsepiae Nux extract (PNE) effectively stimulates the <i>Nrf2</i> signaling pathway, a vital element in cellular antioxidant stress responses. This study further explores the prospective benefits of supplementing PNE into poultry feed to enhance broiler growth in heat-stressed conditions. An <i>Nrf2</i>-luciferase reporter assay was developed in a chicken fibroblast cell line, demonstrating that PNE induces <i>Nrf2</i> activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Real-time RT-PCR results showed that PNE intensifies the expression of <i>Nrf2</i>-responsive targets such as <i>Ho1</i> and <i>Nqo1</i> in chicken fibroblasts. A total of 160 one-day-old Arbor Acres broiler chicks were randomly assigned into four groups, each receiving a basal diet supplemented with either 0% (control), 0.1% PNE, 1% PNE, or commercial electrolyte for 35 days. Broilers were raised in an environment where the ambient temperature exceeded 30 °C for approximately seven hours each day, fluctuating between 26 and 34 °C, which is known to induce mild heat stress. The findings reveal that a 1% PNE supplement led to a significant decrease in the feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to the control group. Moreover, chickens supplemented with 1% PNE exhibited a substantial increase in hepatic mRNA expression of antioxidant genes, such as <i>Nqo1</i>, <i>Gclc</i>, <i>Sod2</i>, <i>Cat</i>, and heat shock protein-related genes including <i>Hsp90</i> and <i>Hsf1</i>, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine genes <i>Il-6</i> and <i>Il-1β</i>. Consequently, PNE holds potential as a feed supplement to strengthen the antioxidant defenses of broilers and build heat stress resilience in the poultry industry.",

    "abstract": "Dietary guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) has been shown to affect creatine (Cr) metabolic pathways resulting in increased cellular Cr and hitherto broiler performances. Yet, the impact of dietary GAA on improving markers of oxidative status remains equivocal. A model of chronic cyclic heat stress, known to inflict oxidative stress, was employed to test the hypothesis that GAA could modify bird's oxidative status. A total of 720-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were allocated to 3 treatments: 0, 0.6 or 1.2 g/kg GAA was added to corn-SBM diets and fed for 39 d, with 12 replicates (20 birds each) per treatment. The chronic cyclic heat stress model (34°C with 50-60% RH for 7 h daily) was applied in the finisher phase (d 25-39). Samples from 1 bird per pen were taken on d 26 (acute heat stress) and d 39 (chronic heat stress). GAA and Cr in plasma were linearly increased by feeding GAA on either sampling day, illustrating efficient absorption and methylation, respectively. Energy metabolism in breast and heart muscle was greatly supported as visible by increased Cr and phosphocreatine: ATP, thus providing higher capacity for rapid ATP generation in cells. Glycogen stores in breast muscle were linearly elevated by incremental GAA, on d 26 only. More Cr seems to be directed to heart muscle as opposed to skeletal muscle during chronic heat stress as tissue Cr was higher in heart but lower in breast muscle on d 39 as opposed to d 26. The lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde, and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase showed no alterations by dietary GAA in plasma. Opposite to that, superoxide dismutase activity in breast muscle was linearly lowered when feeding GAA (trend on d 26, effect on d 39). Significant correlations between the assessed parameters and GAA inclusion were identified on d 26 and d 39 using principal component analysis. To conclude, beneficial performance in heat-stressed broilers by GAA is associated with enhanced muscle energy metabolism which indirectly may also support tolerance against oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "L-Leucine (L-Leu) was demonstrated to confer thermotolerance by <i>in ovo</i> feeding in broiler chicks and chickens in our previous studies. However, the L-Leu-mediated roles in recovering from the detrimental effects of heat stress in broilers are still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of L-Leu <i>in ovo</i> feeding on the growth performance, relative weight of organs, serum metabolites and antioxidant parameters, and gene expression profiles in broiler chickens after chronic heat stress. Fertilized broiler eggs (Ross 308) were subjected to <i>in ovo</i> feeding of sterile water (0.5 mL/egg) or L-Leu (69 μmol/0.5 mL/egg) on embryonic day 7. After hatching, the male chicks were separated and used for the current study. All chickens were subjected to thermal stress exposure from 21 to 39 days of age and 1 week of recovery from 40 to 46 days of age. The results showed that <i>in ovo</i> feeding of L-Leu did not affect the body weight gain or relative weight of organs under chronic heat stress; however, the serum glutathione peroxidase was significantly increased and serum malondialdehyde was significantly decreased by L-Leu at 39 days of age. After 1 week of recovery, <i>in ovo</i> feeding of L-Leu significantly improved the relative spleen weight at 46 days of age. Subsequent RNA-seq analysis in the spleen showed that a total of 77 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 62 upregulated DEGs and 15 downregulated DEGs. Aspartic-type endopeptidase and peptidase activities were upregulated after recovery in the L-Leu group. The expression of genes related to B cell homeostatic proliferation and vestibular receptor cell differentiation, morphogenesis and development was downregulated in the L-Leu group. Moreover, the concentrations of serum catalase, total antioxidative capacity, isoleucine and ammonia were significantly decreased by L-Leu <i>in ovo</i> feeding after recovery. These results suggested that L-Leu <i>in ovo</i> feeding promoted the recovery of antioxidative status after chronic heat stress in broiler chickens.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "The aim was to detect effects of blue light on reducing the adverse effect of heat stress in thermal manipulation (TM) of broiler embryos by subjecting embryos to heat stress during incubation development. Eggs were assigned to four treatments in which the TM (thermal manipulation) was exposed to 40°C for 4 h daily during five successive days, if TM was operated. The treatments were (1) normal temperature with white lighting group (37°C+W), (2) normal temperature with blue lighting group (37°C+B), (3) thermal manipulation with white lighting group (40°C+W), and (4) thermal manipulation with blue lighting group (40°C+B). Blue light significantly lowered MDA and corticosterone concentrations in the embryonic liver. Additionally, the damage of embryonic liver tissue caused by heat stress could be reduced by blue light. HSPs and HSFs gene expression of chicken liver were modulated by blue light significantly, whereas the effects were different, respectively. Moreover, blue light modulated liver antioxidant enzyme activity and their gene expression in embryonic liver significantly. However, blue light did not exert significant effects on body weight, late hatch rectal temperature and tibia length of hatched chicks. The results suggest that monochromatic blue light can reduce the content of MDA and corticosterone of broiler embryos in heat stress and increase the relative expression of SOD and CAT genes. Moreover, the monochromatic blue light may reduce the metabolic heat production of broilers during the embryonic stage, thus reducing the damage of broilers due to heat stress during the embryonic heat acclimation stage.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the interaction of the zinc source (ZnSO<sub>4</sub> vs. zinc amino acid complex) and vitamin E level (50 IU/kg vs. 100 IU/kg) on meat yield and quality in broilers subjected to chronic cyclic heat stress in the finisher phase. A total of 1224 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly distributed among four dietary treatments. Each treatment contained nine replicates of 34 birds, housed in floor pens in a temperature- and lighting-controlled room. Treatments were organized in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement: two sources of zinc, 60 mg/kg of Zn as ZnSO<sub>4</sub> or 60 mg/kg of Zn as zinc amino acid complexes (ZnAA), combined with two levels of vitamin E (50 or 100 IU/kg). From day 28 until day 37 (finisher phase), all birds were subjected to chronic cyclic heat stress (32 ± 2°C for 6 h daily). In the present study, it was observed that replacing ZnSO<sub>4</sub> with ZnAA increased breast meat weight and yield of broilers reared under chronic cyclic heat stress conditions, whereas total slaughter yield was not affected. Moreover, it was observed that replacing ZnSO<sub>4</sub> with ZnAA resulted in breast meat with a lower drip and thawing loss and a higher marinade uptake. In conclusion, replacing ZnSO<sub>4</sub> with more readily available ZnAA can improve breast meat yield and increase the water-holding capacity of breast meat of broilers exposed to chronic cyclic heat stress at the end of the production cycle. However, as no thermoneutral group was included in the present study, the observed effects of the zinc source cannot be generalized as a solution for heat stress. Moreover, the beneficial effects of ZnAA on breast meat yield and quality seem to be independent of the vitamin E level, and increasing vitamin E level has no additional beneficial effects.",

    "abstract": "The modern broiler industry faces huge challenges to keep high production quality and quantity, especially under environmental heat stress conditions. The negative effect of heat stress on broiler productivity is mediated by oxidative stress induction. The blue-green alga (<i>Spirulina platensis</i>) has many applications in poultry nutrition with the high levels of bioactive antioxidant compounds, which can alleviate the oxidative stress damage induced by high ambient temperature. The current study was designed to investigate the effects of dietary <i>Spirulina</i> inclusion at different levels on growth performance, redox status, carcass traits, meat quality, blood hematology, and metabolites profile of broilers subjected to cyclic heat stress. A total of 300 one-day-old Cobb-500 broiler chicks were recruited. Starting from day 21 to 42 of age, birds were randomly divided into five treatment groups with 6 replicates × 10 birds per group, where the first one was provided with the basal diet and reared under normal thermal conditions (23 ± 1 °C) to serve as a negative control. Meanwhile, the other four groups were exposed to cyclic heat stress (34 ± 1 °C for 8 h per day) and were fed a basal diet supplemented with <i>Spirulina</i> at a concentration of 0, 0.5, 1 or 1.5%. <i>Spirulina</i> supplementation to heat-stressed broilers was able to alleviate the negative impacts of heat stress on the final average daily gain, body weight and feed conversion ratio, with the best impact observed among the chickens fed 1% <i>Spirulina</i>. Hematological results indicate increasing hemoglobin and hematocrit levels with <i>Spirulina</i> supplementation compared to the non-supplemented stressed group. Further, <i>Spirulina</i> supplementation significantly influenced blood lipid metabolites marked by reduced serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. The lipid peroxidation level was reduced (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while the antioxidant enzyme activity was increased with <i>Spirulina</i> supplementation to the heat-stressed group. <i>Spirulina</i> supplementation at 0.5 or 1% improved carcass dressing, breast and leg percentages.

Four hundred fifty one-day-old Ross-308 chicks were allocated to 9 dietary groups with 5 replicates (10 chicks each). The control diet was consisted of corn-soybean-based basal diet. The obtained results displayed a significant increase in final body weight (p = 0.005) and weight gain during the periods from 22 to 35 days (p = 0.002) and 1 to 35 days (p = 0.005) in birds fed supplemented diets compared to those fed control diet, with the highest being in birds fed with both 10 g SP and 0.1 mg SeNPs. Feed conversion ratio was also improved in birds fed supplemented compared to control group. Dietary supplements significantly improved carcass dressing (p < 0.001), carcass yield (p = 0.001) percentages, and blood lipid profile. Blood triiodothyronine was higher (p = 0.005) with all treated diets except that contain 5 g SP compared to the control, with the highest being in birds fed diet contains 5 g SP + 0.2 mg SeNPs.

    "abstract": "Spirulina, the blue green algae is considered to exhibit multifaceted benefits on both human health and animal production. Three hundred sixty day old unsexed broiler chicks of CARIBROVISHAL strain were assigned to five treatment groups each comprising nine replicates of 8 chicks. The experiment was carried out during the hot humid summer season (Mid-April to May) under deep litter rearing system with uniform managemental conditions. Birds were administered orally with Spirulina through drinking water in the morning (06:00-12:00 PM) on daily basis throughout the experimental period at 5, 10, 15 and 20 gL<sup>-1</sup> concentration. Spirulina supplementation neither improved nor compromised production performance of broilers reared during hot climatic condition. Results based on one way analysis of variance indicated a significant effect on haemoglobin and total red blood cell count. Serum lipid content and transaminases were reduced, while serum protein concentration was higher (P < 0.01) in the groups administered with 15 and 20 gL<sup>-1</sup> of Spirulina. The extent of imparting shank pigmentation was improved in all the supplemented groups. Cell mediated and humoral immunity against Phytoheamagglutunin-P and Newcastle disease vaccination respectively were maximized (P < 0.05) at 20 gL<sup>-1</sup>. These findings provide direct evidence of dose-related modulation of production, physiological and immunological attributes by Spirulina engendering its further investigation as a potential source of drinking water supplement for stress alleviation in broilers. From the results, it may concluded that Spirulina can be incorporated at 15 or 20 gL<sup>-1</sup> for achieving optimal improvement of health and welfare attributes in broilers reared during hot summer without compromising production.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Global warming and climate changes have a detrimental impact on poultry production, causing substantial economic losses. This study investigated the effects of incorporating dietary betaine (BT) and organic minerals (OMs) on broilers' performance as well as their potential to mitigate the negative impacts of heat stress (HS). Six hundred 1-day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly allocated to 12 experimental treatments with 5 replicates of 10 birds each (5 male + 5 female). The birds were provided with diets containing BT (0 and 2,000 ppm) and OMs (0, 250, and 500 ppm), either individually or in combination, under both thermoneutral and HS-inducing temperatures. The HS conditions involved exposing the birds to cyclic periods of elevated temperature (35°C ± 2°C) for 6 h daily, from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, starting from d 10 and continuing until d 35. The exposure to HS deteriorated birds' growth performance; however, dietary BT and OMs inclusion improved the growth performance parameters bringing them close to normal levels. Carcass traits were not affected by dietary supplementation of BT, OMs, HS, or their interaction. Interestingly, while HS led to increased (P < 0.05) levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), these adverse effects were mitigated (P < 0.05) by the addition of BT and OMs. Moreover, dietary BT supplementation led to elevated serum total protein and globulin concentrations. Cyclic HS did not alter Mn, Zn, and Cu contents in the pectoral muscle. However, the incorporation of OMs at both levels increased concentrations of these minerals. Notably, the combination of 500 ppm OMs and 2,000 ppm BT improved Mn, Zn, Cu, and Fe digestibility, which has been compromised under HS conditions. Cyclic HS upregulated gene expression of interleukin-1β, heat shock protein 70, and Toll-like receptor-4 while downregulated the expression of claudin-1, uncoupling protein, growth hormone receptor, superoxide dismutase 1, glutathione peroxidase 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1. The aforementioned gene expressions were reversed by the combination of higher dietary levels of BT and OMs. In conclusion, the dietary supplementation of 500 ppm OMs along with 2,000 ppm BT yielded significant improvements in growth performance and mineral digestibility among broiler chickens, regardless of thermal conditions. Moreover, this combination effectively restored the expression of growth-related genes even under heat-stress conditions.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) has become one of the important factors affecting the development of animal husbandry. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether vitamin C (Vc) and betaine (Bet) improve immune organ index and humoral immunity by enhancing the antioxidant status of immune organs, thus protecting broilers from HS-induced injuries. A total of 200 28-day-old Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned into 5 groups (n = 4 replicates/group, 10 broilers/replicate) which were reared at different ambient temperatures (24 ± 1°C or 33 ± 1°C). The control group fed basal diet, while high-temperature groups were either fed a basal diet (HS group) or a basal diet supplemented with 250-mg Vc/kg diet (HSVc group), 1000-mg Bet/kg diet (HSBet group), and 250-mg Vc plus 1000 mg Bet/kg diet (HSVcBet group), respectively. On day 42, growth performance, humoral immune function, immune organ index, and antioxidant capacity were measured. HS reduced the productive performance of broilers, antibody potency against the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and sheep red blood cells (SRBC), indices of thymus and bursa, and antioxidant capacity of immune organs. Adding Vc alone or in combination with Bet improved performance, NDV and SRBC antibody potency, thymus and bursa indices, and antioxidant capacity of immune organs in heat-stressed broilers, with the most effective being combination. In summary, HS reduces the antioxidant capacity and immune organ development status of broiler immune organs. Vc and/or Bet can improve the development of immune organs and restore part of the production performance by regulating the antioxidant status of immune organs, among which the combined addition of Vc and Bet has the best effect.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "There is an extensive search for natural products that can be introduced to broiler rations to improve performance, especially during the unfavorable breeding conditions. Under heat-stress conditions, the immune response seriously deteriorates, which consequently impairs broiler production performance. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potentials of <i>Citrullus colocynthis</i> seeds (CCs) supplementation to modulate the immune response of broilers subjected to chronic heat stress. A total of 300 Cobb-500 male broiler chickens aged 21 days were randomly divided into two equal groups and reared under either thermo-neutral condition (24 ± 1 °C) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (34 ± 1 °C for 8 h). Each group was further divided into two groups (5 replicate × 15 chicks) and was fed either the basal diet or the basal diet with 0.1% CCs supplementation. The results showed that heat stress impaired the production performance by lowering the final body weight and feed intake as well as impairing feed conversion. The levels of stress markers (i.e., malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α and corticosterone) increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05), whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased in broilers exposed to heat stress. Further, heat stress caused direct suppression of broiler humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes proliferation, as well as the antibody titer against sheep red blood cells, were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduced by heat-stress exposure. However, CCs supplementation to broilers subjected to heat stress improved (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the final body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the non-supplemented stressed group. The cellular and cell-mediated immune response indicators significantly enhanced (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with CCs supplementation. Supplementation of CCs to broilers reared under similar environmental conditions elevated the total white blood cells (TWBCs) count and the broiler stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes. It can be concluded that CC seeds can be effectively used to stimulate the immune response and improve the production performance of broilers reared under heat-stress condition.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "Embryonic thermal manipulation (TM) is a promising strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress on poultry productivity. The aim of this study was to provide a scientometric analysis of the current literature on embryonic TM in broilers, indicating trends, geographic distribution, influential authors, and multidisciplinary links, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview. A search was carried out in December 2024 on Scopus, PubMed, Scielo, and Web of Science using the keywords (\"thermal manipulation\" OR \"temperature manipulation\" OR \"temperature control\" OR \"incubation temperature\") AND (\"incubation\" OR \"embryo\" OR \"fetal development\") AND broiler. No date restrictions or filters were applied. Only articles that evaluated the TM of embryonated eggs from broilers were selected. Using a dataset of 195 publications from 1994 to 2024, the data were analyzed with Bibliometrix and VOSviewer tools. A sharp increase in scientific output was observed in the last decade, with 71 % of studies published after 2015. Actual central themes include thermotolerance, heat stress, performance, and hatchability. Emerging themes include gene expression, antioxidant, immune response, and acute heat stress. Nine main research networks were identified, with limited interconnection. The United States, Brazil, and Turkey were identified as the main countries, and São Paulo State University, Jordan University of Science and Technology, and Wageningen University are the main research institutions. This study shows how TM during egg incubation has become important in broilers and how it can help them handle heat stress better. Future research should focus on combining TM with genetic, nutritional, and environmental strategies to make the birds more productive and sustainable.",

All administrations were given via feed from D1 to D35 of this study. Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities were highly significant (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) in the treatment groups compared to the control. Performance indicators (water intake and body weight gain) were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the probiotic and probiotic + ascorbic acid group. The height of duodenal, jejunal and ileal villi, and goblet cell counts of broiler chickens were significantly different in the treatment groups. In conclusion, the study showed that heat stress negatively affects the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, performance and the morphology of small intestinal epithelium, while the antioxidants were efficacious in ameliorating these adverse effects.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Heat stress is a significant problem in the poultry industry, causing a severe economic loss due to its detrimental effects on chickens' health and performance. Dried plum (DP) is a good source of minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and phenolic compounds. Studies have suggested that DP has several health benefits, such as maintaining the body's redox system, immune status, and calcium hemostasis. Based on the health benefits of DP, we hypothesized that the dietary supplementation of DP would alleviate the detrimental effects of heat stress on broiler chickens. To test the hypothesis, day-old broiler chicks (n = 72) were randomly allocated to three treatment groups (n = 24/group): no heat stress (NHS), heat stress (HS), and heat stress with dried plum (HS + DP), and reared under standard conditions. The inclusion of 2.5% DP in the feed of the HS + DP group was made during the treatment period, while birds in other groups were provided with a standard finisher diet. After 21 days, birds in the HS and HS + DP groups were exposed to cyclic heat stress conditions (33 °C for 8 h during daytime) for 3 weeks, while those in the NHS group were reared under normal conditions (22-24 °C). Weekly body weight and feed intake were recorded to calculate the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Heat stress significantly decreased the final body weight, ADG, ADFI, and increased FCR compared to the NHS group, whereas dietary supplementation of DP significantly improved these growth performance parameters compared to the HS group. Furthermore, supplementation of DP significantly increased the expression of heat shock protein-related genes (HSF1, HSF3, HSP70, and HSP90), antioxidant-related genes (SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX3, PRDX1, and TXN), tight junction-related genes (CLDN1, and OCLN), and immune-related genes (IL4, MUC2) in the ileum as compared to the HS group. The microbiota analysis showed significant enrichment of Bacillales, Christensenellaceae, Bacillaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Anaerotruncus in heat-stressed birds supplemented with DP as compared to the HS group. Further, DP supplementation also significantly increased the concentration of acetate, propionate, and total VFA in the cecal digesta of the HS + DP group as compared to the HS group. These findings suggest that DP supplementation effectively improved the growth performances and gut health parameters in the heat-stressed birds. Thus, dried plum can be a potential feed supplement to mitigate heat stress in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "High environmental temperatures induce heat stress in broiler chickens, affecting their health and production performance. Several dietary, managerial, and genetics strategies have been tested with some success in mitigating heat stress (HS) in broilers. Developing novel HS mitigation strategies for sustaining broiler production is critically needed. This study investigated the effects of pre-hatch thermal manipulation (TM) and post-hatch baicalein supplementation on growth performance and health parameters in heat-stressed broilers. Six hundred fertile Cobb 500 eggs were incubated for 21 d. After candling on embryonic day (ED) 10, 238 eggs were thermally manipulated at 38.5 °C with 55% relative humidity (RH) from ED 12 to 18, then transferred to the hatcher (ED 19 to 21, standard temperature) and 236 eggs were incubated at a controlled temperature (37.5 °C) till hatch. After hatch, 180-day-old chicks from both groups were raised in 36 pens (n = 10 birds/pen, 6 replicates per treatment). The treatments were: 1) Control, 2) TM, 3) control heat stress (CHS), 4) thermal manipulation heat stress (TMHS), 5) control heat stress supplement (CHSS), and 6) thermal manipulation heat stress supplement (TMHSS). All birds were raised under the standard environment for 21 d, followed by chronic heat stress from d 22 to 35 (32-33 °C for 8 h) in the CHS, TMHS, CHSS, and TMHSS groups. A thermoneutral (22-24 °C) environment was maintained in the Control and TM groups. RH was constant (50% ± 5%) throughout the trial. All the data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in R and GraphPad software at P < 0.05 and are presented as mean ± SEM. Heat stress significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the final body weight and ADG in CHS and TMHS groups compared to the other groups. Embryonic TM significantly increased (P < 0.05) the expression of heat shock protein-related genes (HSP70, HSP90, and HSPH1) and antioxidant-related genes (GPX1 and TXN). TMHS birds showed a significant increment (P < 0.05) in total cecal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration compared to the CHS birds. The cecal microbial analysis showed significant enrichment (P < 0.05) in alpha and beta diversity and Coprococcus in the TMHSS group. Pre-hatch TM and post-hatch baicalein supplementation in heat-stressed birds mitigate the detrimental effects of heat stress on chickens' growth performance, upregulate favorable gene expression, increase VFA production, and promote gut health by increasing beneficial microbial communities.",

A total of 640-day-old Cobb male broiler chicks were randomly allocated to 32 floor pens in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement that included ambient temperature (thermoneutral [TN] or heat stress [HS]) and dietary treatments (basal diet or Vit E + Se). Vit E and organic Se were added to the basal diet at the rate of 250 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Liver and jejunum tissue samples were taken on d 27 (1 bird/pen), d 28 and d 35 (2 birds/pen) from birds for qPCR analysis. Data were subjected to a 2-way ANOVA using the GLM procedure of JMP. Ileal contents were taken on d 27 and d 35 for microbial profiling. Microbiota data were analyzed in QIIME 2 and significance between treatments identified linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe, P < 0.05). Dietary Vit E/Se significantly downregulated the mRNA levels of HSPs in liver and jejunal tissues of the HS-challenged birds both on d 28 and d 35. Moreover, mRNA abundance of TLR2, TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-10, and iNOS in the liver were significantly downregulated in birds fed the Vit E/Se diet on d 35. However, dietary treatment had no significant impact on oxidative stress, immunity, and gut integrity related genes analyzed in jejunal tissues on d 28 and d 35, except downregulation of IFNγ on d 35 (P = 0.052). LEfSe analysis revealed that Lachnospiraceae FE2018 and Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 groups was enriched in the Vit E/Se birds on d 35. Moreover, PICRUSt analysis predicted significant functional differences among the treatment groups. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of Vit E/Se mitigated the negative effects of HS potentially via improving antioxidant status, regulating cytokine responses and modifying ileal microbiota and its function.",

This study aims to reveal the effect of adding different oil sources in the diets of broilers exposed to environmental heat stress on performance, digestibility, oxidative status, plasma lipids, fatty acids content, and meat quality. Six hundred twenty-five one-day-old broiler chicks were randomly distributed to five groups as follows: the first group fed a diet without oil (CON) as a control, while the second to the fifth group fed a diet containing soy oil (SO), corn oil (CO), olive oil (OO), and fish oil (FO), respectively. Results indicated a significant deterioration in growth performance, carcass traits, and oxidative state with a significant decrease in carcass quality in heat-stressed chickens fed the CON diet. Results showed increased growth, enhanced feed conversion ratio, and carcass dressing in broilers fed the oil-supplemented diet compared to the control diet, however, the digestive enzymes activity was not affected by receiving an oil-supplemented diet. The best performance was in chickens fed OO and SO, compared with FO and CO. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased in broilers fed an oil-supplemented diet. Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) remarkably increased in broilers fed OO, whereas the malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased compared to the other groups. Adding different dietary oil sources enhanced the breast muscle's fatty acid composition. Broiler diets supplemented with oils positively affected meat quality by enhancing color measurements, and TBA values, while the best were in chicken fed OO. It was concluded that adding dietary oil at 3% in the diets of broiler chicken exposed to environmental heat stress positively affected growth performance, enhanced oxidative status, and meat quality, best results were in broilers fed a diet that included olive oil.",

One hundred twenty 10-d-old male broilers were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups, 3 replicates of 10 birds each. The birds were fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with either 30 mg Zn/kg diet, 4.5 mg (15,000 IU) retinol/kg diet, or 30 mg Zn + 4.5 mg retinol/kg diet. Supplemental zinc and vitamin A significantly increased live weight gain and improved feed efficiency (p<0.05). However, a combination of zinc and vitamin A, rather than each separately, provided a greater performance. Hot and chilled carcass weights and yields and the weights of internal organs with the exception of abdominal fat were greater for each supplement (p<0.05) compared to the control group. Abdominal fat decreased (p<0.05) upon dietary zinc and vitamin A supplementation. Supplemental treatments resulted in an increased total serum protein but decreased glucose, cholesterol, and MDA concentrations. The results of the study show that, separately or as a combination, zinc and vitamin A supplementation resulted in an improved live weight gain, feed efficiency, and carcass traits, as well as a decrease in serum MDA concentrations. The results of the present study also suggest that zinc and vitamin A have similar effects and that a combination of zinc and vitamin A may offer a potential protective management practice in preventing heat-stress-related depression in performance of broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Global warming leading to heat stress (HS) is becoming a major challenge for broiler production. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of seaweed (Enteromorpha prolifera) polysaccharides (EPS) on the intestinal barrier function, microbial ecology, and performance of broilers under HS. A total of 144 yellow-feathered broilers (male, 56 days old) with 682.59 ± 7.38 g were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 1) TN (thermal neutral zone, 23.6 ± 1.8 °C), 2) HS (heat stress, 33.2 ± 1.5 °C for 10 h/d), and 3) HSE (HS + 0.1% EPS). Each group contained 6 replicates with 8 broilers per replicate. The study was conducted for 4 weeks; feed intake and body weights were measured at the end of weeks 2 and 4. At the end of the feeding trial, small intestine samples were collected for histomorphology, antioxidant, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) content, apoptosis, gene and protein expression analysis; cecal contents were also collected for microbiota analysis based on 16S rDNA sequencing. Dietary EPS promoted the average daily gain (ADG) of broilers during 3-4 weeks of HS (P < 0.05). At the end of HS on broilers, the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the content of sIgA in jejunum were improved by EPS supplementation (P < 0.05). Besides, dietary EPS reduced the epithelial cell apoptosis of jejunum and ileum in heat-stressed broilers (P < 0.05). Addition of EPS in HS group broilers' diet upregulated the relative mRNA expression of Occludin, ZO-1, γ-GCLc and IL-10 of the jejunum (P < 0.05), whereas downregulated the relative mRNA expression of NF-κB p65, TNF-α and IL-1β of the jejunum (P < 0.05). Dietary EPS increased the protein expression of Occludin and ZO-1, whereas it reduced the protein expression of NF-κB p65 and MLCK (P < 0.01) and tended to decrease the protein expression of TNF-α (P = 0.094) in heat-stressed broilers. Furthermore, the proportions of Bacteroides and Oscillospira among the three groups were positively associated with jejunal apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with jejunal Occludin level (P < 0.05). However, the proportions of Lactobacillus, Barnesiella, Subdoligranulum, Megasphaera, Collinsella, and Blautia among the three groups were positively related to ADG (P < 0.05). EPS can be used as a feed additive in yellow-feathered broilers. It effectively improves growth performance and alleviates HS-induced intestinal injury by relieving inflammatory damage and improving the tight junction proteins expression. These beneficial effects may be related to inhibiting NF-κB/MLCK signaling pathway activation and regulation of cecal microbiota.",

It was concluded that AHS impaired meat quality, which may be related to oxidative damage, as evidenced by increasing ROS production, MDA content, and decreasing the relative expression of HO-1. Dietary COS supplementation could effectively elevate the meat quality of broilers exposed to AHS via decreasing ROS production, activating the Nrf2 pathway, and Nrf2-mediated HO-1 and GSH-Px gene expression.",

    "abstract": "This study was done to evaluate the effects of heat stress (HS) on production performance, redox status, small intestinal barrier-related parameters, cecal microbiota, and metabolome of indigenous broilers. A total of forty female indigenous broilers (56-day-old) were randomly and equally divided into normal treatment group (NT group, 21.3 ± 1.2°C, 24 h/day) and HS group (32.5 ± 1.4°C, 8 h/day) with five replicates of each for 4 weeks feeding trial. The results showed that the body weight gain (BWG) of broilers in HS group was lower than those in NT group during 3-4 weeks and 1-4 weeks (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The HS exposure increased the abdominal fat rate (<i>p</i> < 0.05) but decreased the thigh muscle rate (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Besides, broilers in HS group had higher drip loss of breast muscle than NT group (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Broilers exposed to HS had lower total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in serum and jejunum, activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the jejunum, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the thigh muscle, duodenum, and jejunum; and catalase (CAT) in breast muscle, duodenum, and jejunum (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Whereas the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in breast muscle, duodenum, and jejunum was elevated by HS exposure (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, the relative mRNA expression of <i>Occludin</i> and <i>ZO-1</i> in the duodenum, <i>Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, ZO-1, Mucin-2</i> in the jejunum, and the <i>Claudin-4</i> and <i>Mucin-2</i> in the ileum was down-regulated by HS exposure (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that the HS group increased the relative abundance of <i>Anaerovorax</i> in the cecum at the genus level (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Cecal metabolomics analysis indicated 19 differential metabolites between the two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.10, VIP >1). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the differential metabolites mainly enriched in 10 signaling pathways such as the Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In summary, chronic HS exposure caused a decline of production performance, reduced antioxidant capacity, disrupted intestinal barrier function, and negatively affected cecal microbiota and metabolome in indigenous broilers.",

    "abstract": "The current experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of individual or combination of dietary betaine (Bet) and glycine (Gly) on productive performance, stress response, liver health, and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens raised under heat stress (HS) conditions. A total of four hundred twenty 21-d-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments with 7 replicates. Birds in treatment 1 were raised under the thermoneutral condition (TN; 23 ± 0.6°C). Birds in other 4 treatment groups were subjected to a cyclic HS by exposing them to 32 ± 0.9°C for 8 h/d (from 09:00 to 17:00 h) and 28 ± 1.2°C for the remaining time for 14 d. Birds were fed a basal diet in TN condition (TN-C) and one group in HS conditions (HS-C), whereas other birds raised under HS conditions were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.20% Bet (HS-Bet), 0.79% Gly (HS-Gly), or their combination (0.20% Bet + 0.79% Gly; HS-Bet+Gly). Results indicated that birds in HS-Bet, HS-Gly, or HS-Bet+Gly treatment had higher (P < 0.05) final BW and BW gain, but lower (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR) than those in HS-C treatment. However, values for improved final BW, BW gain, and FCR by dietary treatments were lower (P < 0.05) than those measured in TN-C treatment. Under HS conditions, birds in HS-Bet, HS-Gly, or HS-Bet+Gly treatment had lower (P < 0.05) heterophil to lymphocyte ratio than those in HS-C treatment. Birds in HS-Gly or HS-Bet+Gly treatment had higher (P < 0.05) villus height and goblet cell number than birds in HS-C treatment. Intestinal permeability was higher (P < 0.05) in all HS-treatment groups than in TN-C treatment, but it was not affected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, individual supplementation of 0.20% Bet or 0.79% Gly in diets alleviates the negative effect of HS in broiler chickens. However, the synergistic effect of the combination of 0.20% Bet and 0.79% Gly in broiler diets seems lower than expected.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that chlorogenic acid (CGA) and its isomers may positively influence the growth performance and antioxidant capacity of broilers. Nevertheless, the growth-promoting and antioxidant activities of CGA and its isomers have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of CGA and its isomers on broilers. We conducted a literature search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases, restricting the language to English. We compared the experimental groups that received CGA or its isomers in their diets with the control groups that were fed the basal diet. We retrieved 192 studies, 15 of which (50 records) were eligible for our analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A random-effects model was employed to calculate the weighted mean difference and the 95 % confidence interval. Under normal growth conditions, the administration of CGA or its isomers significantly enhanced the average daily gain (ADG) of broilers during the periods of 1 to 14 d (P = 0.015) and 1 to 21 d (P = 0.036). Furthermore, it significantly improved the feed conversion ratio (F/G) of broilers over the period of 1 to 42 d (P = 0.009). Additionally, CGA or its isomers markedly increased the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (P < 0.001) and catalase (CAT) (P < 0.001) in the serum of broilers at 14 d, 21 d, and 42 d. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was also significantly elevated at 14 d (P < 0.005), while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly reduced at 14 d (P < 0.001). Under stress conditions, including challenge stress, bacterial infection, and heat stress, CGA or its isomers significantly promoted the ADG of broilers (P < 0.001) and improved the F/G under challenge stress (P < 0.001) and heat stress (P = 0.038). Moreover, the supplementation of CGA or its isomers significantly enhanced the GSH-Px activity in the serum of broilers at 21 d (P = 0.017) and 42 d (P < 0.001), increased the SOD activity at 21 d (P < 0.001), and the CAT activity at 42 d (P < 0.001). It also significantly decreased the MDA content at 21 d and 42 d (P < 0.001). In conclusion, whether under standard growth conditions or stress conditions, the incorporation of CGA or its isomers can effectively enhance the growth performance and serum antioxidant capacity of broilers.",

Under temperatures between 30.21 to 31.82 °C, 240 broiler chickens (Ross-308), which were 7-day-old, were randomly assigned to one of six treatments: T1 (control), T2 (100 mg Zn per kg of diet and 1.5 mg Cr per kg of diet), T3 (0.6 mg Se per kg of diet), T4 (0.9 mg Se per kg of diet), T5 (100 mg Zn, 1.5 mg Cr and (LSe), and T6 (100 mg Zn, 1.5 mg Cr and (HSe)). At 35 days old, the chicks fed a diet containing Zn-Cr with low or high organic selenium (organic-Se) outweighed the control group in terms of live body weight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In comparison to the control treatment, birds fed diets supplemented with Zn-Cr or organic-Se (LSe, HSe) significantly increased their serum levels of total protein and total antioxidant capacity. However, these additives resulted in a decrease (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in their serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, creatinine, and uric acid. Together, it was found that trace elements (Zn-Cr and organic-Se) may greatly lessen the impacts of heat stress on broilers by promoting growth performance and boosting metabolic processes.",

The experiment was carried out with a total of 160-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chickens in a completely randomized design. From 25 days of age, the birds were assigned to four diets including control diet and treatment diets which were supplemented with 2 levels of lemon verbena (0.5% and 1.0%) and one level of vitamin C (250 mg/kg) in 16-floor pens with 10 chickens each and reared to 42 days of age. To induce chronic heat stress, birds were exposed to an ambient temperature of 35 ± 2 °C for 8 h daily (from 09:00 AM until 17:00 PM) between 25 and 42 days of age. At the end of experiment, one chick/pen was randomly selected, and the performance and blood parameters were evaluated. Dietary supplementation of 1.0% lemon verbena increased (p < 0.05) average weight gain and feed intake by 5.81% and 3.29%, and reduced feed conversion ratio by 2.59% respectively compared to control group. Birds fed diets containing 1.0% lemon verbena had significantly higher relative weight of bursa of fabricius and breast (p < 0.05). LDL decreased by 15.85% and 17.57%, for birds fed 0.5% and 1.0% lemon verbena respectively. The ratio of heterophyl to lymphocyte was reduced (p < 0.05) by 20.68% via significant decrease in heterophyl by 15.55% and significant increase in lymphocyte by 4.51% in birds fed lemon verbena at the rate of 1.0% compared to those fed the control diet. 1.0% lemon verbena and vitamin C elevated (p = 0.0005) the level of glutathione peroxidase by 51.81% and 27.90%, respectively. In conclusion, lemon verbena and vitamin C improved some performance data and blood metabolites which somehow suppressed the negative effects of heat stress.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Climate change has numerous effects on poultry that result in welfare concerns and economic losses in agricultural industries. However, the mechanisms underlying the acclimation to heat stress in poultry have not been comprehensively defined. Therefore, identifying associated patterns of gene regulation and understanding the molecular mechanisms of acclimation to a warmer environment will provide insights into the acclimation system of broiler chickens. We profiled differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with differences in growth performance under heat stress conditions in the liver tissues of broilers based on RNA sequencing data. The DEGs were identified by comparison to the gene expression levels of broilers exhibiting average growth at 28 d of age (D28A) and D36A relative to those at D21A. In D36A, 507 and 312 DEGs were up- and downregulated, respectively, whereas 400 and 156 DEGs were up- and downregulated in D28A, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis further revealed that \"fatty acid degradation\" and \"heat shock protein expression\" were upregulated in broilers exhibiting a higher growth and weight, whereas \"cell cycle arrest\" and \"amino acid metabolism\" were downregulated. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the acclimatized group supplied fat and energy from the liver to tissues through the breakdown of fatty acids. Furthermore, homeostasis was maintained via heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes. The characterized candidate genes and mechanisms associated with the response to heat stress might serve as a foundation for improving the ability of broilers to acclimatize under heat stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidants such as vitamin C (VC) and green tea extract (GTE) have been reported to have various antioxidant functions and are used as one of the nutritional approaches to alleviate heat stress (HS) in chickens. However, studies on the feeding timing that can produce optimal effects have not been reported. In this study, the stress-relieving effect of VC and GTE addition timing was investigated in high-temperature broiler chickens. A total of 880 1-d-old male chickens were used, and the treatments were as follows: no feed additives provided, CON; VC 250 mg/kg added from 1 d, VC1; GTE 600 mg/kg added from 1 d, GTE1; VC 250 mg/kg added from 22 d, VC22; GTE 600 mg/kg added from 22 d, GTE22. The HS environment was provided for 2 wk from the 22 d and was set at 33 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 10% for 24 h. Feed and water were provided ad libitum. Broiler production was similar in all treatments. In chicken meat quality, the addition of VC and GTE had an effect on meat color and pH (P < 0.05). In particular, GTE had a positive effect on the antioxidant capacity and quality preservation of breast meat (P < 0.05). In blood characteristics, GTE1 significantly lowered the level of total cholesterol, and VC1 affected AST and IgM (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the VC1 group had a positive effect on the maintenance and development of intestinal morphology, a lower rectal temperature, and showed to relieve stress. In conclusion, the addition of VC and GTE has been shown to alleviate the high-temperature stress of broilers, and in the case of VC in particular, feeding from 1 d appeared to alleviate stress more effectively. This study suggests that it is important to determine the appropriate timing of addition of functional substances in order to effectively reduce various stresses that occur in livestock rearing.",

However, organic zinc had little or no effects on the production parameters measures in the current project. Overall, intestinal histological measurements were negatively altered under HS relative to TN chicks. Organic zinc inclusion in the diet had improved villus height in the duodenum and jejunum relative to the Ctrl and CHS chicks. Blood calcium and glucose levels were decreased and increased, respectively, in HS relative to TN chicks. In summary, the results discussed in the current project revealed that the inclusion rates of organic zinc used here had little or no effects on the productive parameters.

A total of 336 mixed-sex Ross 308 broiler chicks (one-day-old) were randomly assigned into two groups; The thermoneutral group (TN, broilers were raised at 24 ± 1°C); and the heat stress group (HS; broilers were exposed to 32°C to 34°C, 8 h/d from day 21 to 27; the temperature in the remaining time was same as TN group). All birds in each group were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments-Negative control (NC) (without seaweed), NC + 1 mL seaweed extract (SWE) in drinking water, NC + 2 mL SWE in drinking water, and NC + 2% seaweed meal (SWM) in feed. Each treatment was assigned to six replicates with 7 broilers/replicate. Average body weight gain (ABWG), average feed intake (AFI), average water intake (AWI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality were determined weekly. On day 28, two male birds/cage were euthanized to collect blood and immune organs for subsequent biochemical, antioxidant, and immune status analysis. Data were analyzed as a 4 × 2  factorial analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of Minitab software. Overall, 2% SWM inclusion significantly increased (P < 0.05) the AFI, ABWG, and AWI of broiler chickens irrespective of HS. HS significantly reduced (P < 0.05) AFI and increased (P < 0.05) the bird's rectal temperature, plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, glucose, amylase, and uric acid compared to TN birds. HS increased (P < 0.05) serum IgM and IgG and decreased plasma glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase compared to TN birds, while the activity of superoxide dismutase was not affected by HS and dietary treatments. 1 mL SWE in water and 2% SWM in feed significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the plasma activity of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase of heat-stressed broilers, respectively compared to other treatments. Conclusively, dietary supplementation of brown seaweed improved the growth performance of birds irrespective of HS and may help to reduce the negative effects of HS by improving the plasma enzyme activities of heat-stressed birds.",

    "abstract": "1. Dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) has been used to minimise problems in broiler chickens raised in warm climates. However, there is a need to determine the most appropriate DEB levels in these animals2. This study evaluated the influence of five DEB levels (110, 175, 240, 305 and 370 mEq/kg) on water intake (WI), zootechnical performance (feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio), tibiotarsus bone variables (fresh bone weight, dry bone weight, bone length, mineral matter, Seedor index and bone strength) and intestinal histomorphometry (villus height (VH) and width (VW), crypt height (CH) and width (CW), internal and external muscularis) on broilers in two developmental phases (1-21 and 22-42 d of age). Additionally, the haematological profile (blood count and serum biochemistry), carcass yield, cuts and abdominal fat were assessed.3. Applying 370 mEq/kg DEB increased WI, VW in the jejunum and ileum and number of haemocytes at 21 d, while WI and VW in the duodenum and ileum at 42 d. In contrast, 110 mEq/kg increased chlorine concentrations at 21 d and leukocyte and heterophil numbers at 42 d.4. In summary, the 370 mEq/kg level was the most appropriate for broiler homoeostasis raised under natural heat stress, as the best results were found on WI and VW variables. Therefore, this DEB level was recommended in broilers aged 21 or 42 d.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "The effects of nano-emulsified vegetable oil (NEVO) and betaine (BET) supplements on growth performance and meat qualities of broilers reared under cyclic heat stress (HS) were investigated. Two hundred and eighty-eight mixed-sex broilers at 21 d were randomly distributed to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments formed by two environmental temperatures (thermoneutral (TN; 24 ± 1 °C) and cyclic high-temperature (HT; 35 ± 1 °C)) and three dietary treatments (control (CON), NEVO, and BET). The cumulative performance (21-35 d) revealed a reduction in average daily gain (ADG) (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the CON compared to NEVO. NEVO and BET groups had a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) and performance efficiency factor (PEF) compared with the CON (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i> < 0.01, respectively). The environmental temperature affected daily feed intake (DFI), ADG, FCR, and PEF. The addition of BET improved breast fillets yield, temperature, pH<sub>15min,</sub> and pH<sub>24hr</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in comparison with the CON. Moreover, the TN group had lower fillet temperature and higher pH<sub>15min</sub> compared to the HT. Moreover, HT increased shear force (SF), hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness of the fillets compared to TN. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with BET and NEVO could effectively improve performance parameters and meat characteristics under HS conditions.",

A total of 224 1-day-old male Cobb chicks were randomly allocated to seven groups of dietary treatments (n = 32). Seven isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were formulated. ZnO NPs were added to the basal diet at seven different levels, 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 ppm/kg diet, respectively, for 35 days. Results indicated that live body weight (g) did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) between treatment groups, whereas compared to control, the 5 ppm ZnO NPs/kg diet recorded the highest live body weight at 21 and 35 days. No significant effects for the feed consumption (g/bird/period) and feed conversion ratio (g feed/g gain) among treated and control birds were observed. Hematological and immunological variables showed significant (P ≤ 0.05) dose-dependent modulations by ZnO NP supplementation. Significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences were observed in the phagocytic activity, phagocytic index, and IgM and IgG between the treatment groups, with the 5 and 10 ppm ZnO NPs/kg diet recording the best values, followed by the 20 ppm ZnO NPs/kg diet. Different supplementations had nonsignificant effects on the digestibility of nutrients (P ≤ 0.05). Histopathological pictures of the kidney, liver, and lymphoid organs, ultrastructural examination of muscle tissues, and expression of inflammatory cytokines showed dose-dependent morphological and structural changes. In conclusion, the ZnO NP supplementation in broiler diet to eliminate the heat stress hazards in summer season is recommended in dose level of not more than 10 ppm/kg diet.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "A 28-day study was done to explore the impact of nano-iron alone or combined with methionine on growth, blood chemistry, liver biomarkers, and tissue histology of heat-stressed chicken. One-day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly allocated to three groups. Each group was divided into three replicates (13 chicks/replicate). The first group was the control one that was fed a basal diet without supplementation (T0). The second group was fed a basal diet with nano-iron 4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> diet (T1). The third group was fed a basal diet with nano-iron 4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> diet plus methionine 4 g kg<sup>-1</sup> diet (T2). The results showed that the birds in the control group had significantly (p < 0.05) higher final weights. Also, a partial relief of heat stress adverse effects was observed on growth by T1 compared to T2. The T2 showed a significantly increased (p < 0.05) free iron (Fe) level and transferrin saturation index. Likewise, T2 significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin level in comparison with T0 and T1. Also, hepatic impairment and inflammatory response were observed in the T2 group when compared to T0 and T1, besides a bad lipid profile. Further, T2 showed raised levels of Fe and ferritin in their hepatic tissues compared to those T1 and T0. A significant increment of thiobarbituric acid reactive and decrement of reduced glutathione levels in the hepatic tissues of T2 and T1 versus T0 levels were recorded. It is concluded that nano-iron at the level of 4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in this study is highly absorbed, leading to harmful effects. Further investigations are needed to detect the proper supplemental level.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Wooden breast (WB) is a degenerative myopathy seen in modern broiler birds resulting in quality downgrade of breast fillets. Affected filets show increased toughness both before as well as after cooking and have decreased water holding capacity and marinade pick up compared to normal fillets. Although the exact etiology is unknown, the circulatory insufficiency and increased oxidative stress in the breast muscles of modern broiler birds could be resulting in damage and degeneration of muscle fibers leading to myopathies. Three independent experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of various dietary interventions on the incidence of WB when birds are exposed to oxidative stress associated with feeding oxidized fat and mild heat stress. Feed additives such as dietary antioxidant [Ethoxyquin (ETX)], mineral methionine hydroxy analog chelate (MMHAC) of Zn, Cu, and Mn, and organic selenium (Org Se) were tested at recommended levels. In experiment 1, ETX reduced (<i>P</i> < 0.05) the incidence of severe WB induced by oxidized fat diet. The magnitude of improvement in percentage of normal (no WB) filets and reduction in muscle lipid peroxidation was greater (<i>P</i> < 0.05) when ETX and MMHAC were fed together as shown by experiment 2. In birds exposed to mild heat stress (Experiment 3), feeding MMHAC by itself reduced (<i>P</i> < 0.05) tissue damage by reducing incidence of tibial head lesions, skin scratches, breast blisters, in addition to increasing the incidence of normal (no WB) fillets. When MMHAC was combined with ETX and Org Se, further improvement (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in normal (no WB) filets was observed. In summary, under different oxidative stress conditions, dietary intervention programs that contain ETX, MMHA-Zn, -Cu, and -Mn and Org Se can improve performance and increase carcass integrity, reducing problems, such as WB, either independently or with additive effect. This effect is most likely attained by simultaneously improving the exogenous and endogenous antioxidant status, reducing oxidative stress, and improving tissue healing process of the bird.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "The exposure of broiler chickens to high ambient temperatures causes heat stress (HS), negatively affecting their health and production performance. To mitigate heat stress in broilers, various strategies, including dietary, managerial, and genetic interventions, have been extensively tested with varying degrees of efficacy. For sustainable broiler production, it is imperative to develop an innovative approach that effectively mitigates the adverse effects of HS. Our previous studies have provided valuable insights into the effects of prehatch embryonic thermal manipulation (TM) and posthatch baicalein supplementation on embryonic thermotolerance, metabolism, and posthatch growth performance. This follow-up study investigated the effect of these interventions on gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism in the liver, as well as muscle proliferation and regeneration capacity in heat-stressed broiler chickens. A total of six-hundred fertile Cobb 500 eggs were incubated for 21 d. After candling, 238 eggs were subjected to TM at 38.5°C with 55% relative humidity (RH) from embryonic day (ED) 12 to 18. These eggs were transferred to the hatcher and kept at a standard temperature (37.5°C) from ED 19 to 21, while 236 eggs were incubated at a controlled temperature (37.5°C) till hatch. After hatching, 180 day-old chicks from both groups were raised in 36 pens treatment (n = 10 birds/pen, 6 replicates per treatment). The treatments were: 1) Control, 2) TM, 3) Control heat stress (CHS), 4) Thermal manipulation heat stress (TMHS), 5) Control heat stress supplement (CHSS), and 6) Thermal manipulation heat stress supplement (TMHSS). Baicalein was added to the treatment group diets starting from d 1. All birds were raised under the standard environment for 21 d, followed by chronic heat stress from d 22 to 35 (32-33 ⁰C for 8 h) in the CHS, TMHS, CHSS, and TMHSS groups. A thermoneutral (22-24⁰C) environment was maintained in the Control and TM groups. RH was constant (50 ± 5%) throughout the trial. In the liver, TM significantly increased (P < 0.05) IGF2 expression. Baicalein supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) HSF3, HSP70, SOD1, SOD2, TXN, PRARα, and GHR expression. Moreover, the combination of TM and baicalein supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the expression of HSPH1, HSPB1, HSP90, LPL, and GHR. In the muscle, TM significantly increased (P < 0.05) HSF3 and Myf5 gene expression. TM and baicalein supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the expression of MyoG and significantly (P < 0.05) decreased mTOR and PAX7. In conclusion, the prehatch TM of embryos and posthatch baicalein supplementation mitigated the deleterious effects of HS on broiler chickens by upregulating genes related to liver gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and muscle proliferation.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Broiler chicks are fast-growing and susceptible to dietary selenium (Se) deficiency. This study sought to reveal the underlying mechanisms of how Se deficiency induces key organ dysfunctions in broilers. Day-old male chicks (n=6 cages/diet, 6 chicks/cage) were fed with a Se-deficient diet (Se-Def, 0.047 mg Se/kg) or the Se-Def+0.3 mg Se/kg (Control, 0.345 mg Se/kg) for 6 weeks. The serum, liver, pancreas, spleen, heart, and pectoral muscle of the broilers were collected at week 6 to assay for Se concentration, histopathology, serum metabolome, and tissue transcriptome. Compared with the Control group, Se deficiency induced growth retardation and histopathological lesions and reduced Se concentration in the five organs. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis revealed that dysregulation of immune and redox homeostasis related biological processes and pathways contributed to Se deficiency-induced multiple tissue damage in the broilers. Meanwhile, four metabolites in the serum, daidzein, epinephrine, L-aspartic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, interacted with differentially expressed genes with antioxidative effects and immunity among all the five organs, which contributed to the metabolic diseases induced by Se deficiency. Overall, this study systematically elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Se deficiency-related diseases, which provides a better understanding of the significance of Se-mediated heath in animals.",

The chickens in the HT and Gln + HT groups were reared under HT (36 ± 1 °C for 10 h/d and 22 ± 1 °C for 14 h/d), for 21 days. In contrast to the NS group, heat stress caused a reduction in the body weight gain (BWG); feed intake (FI); activity of trypsin, lipase, alkaline phosphatases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> adenosine triphosphatases, and Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase; and content of glutathione and d-xylose (P < 0.05) in the other groups. In addition, compared to the F:G and expression levels in the NS group, the heat stress increased the feed intake:body weight gain (F:G) and mRNA expression levels of SGLT1, CaBP-D28k, and L-GSBP (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HT-challenged birds were pretreated with Gln, the BWG; FI; activity of trypsin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> adenosine triphosphatases, and Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase; and content of glutathione and d-xylose (P < 0.05) were dramatically increased, but it decreased the F:G and mRNA expression levels of SGLT1, CaBP-D28k, and L-GSBP (P < 0.05) in the HT group. In summary, Gln can effectively improve growth performance and may promote digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract by mediating the mRNA expression level of nutrient transporters and Gln metabolism in heat-stressed broilers.",

Owing to the unique properties of extracted polyphenols, resveratrol-loaded liposomal nanoparticles (Resv-Lipo NPs) were first explored to mitigate the harmful effects of HS. The dietary role of Resv-Lipo NPs in heat-stressed birds was investigated based on their growth performance, antioxidative potential, and the expression of heat shock proteins, sirtuins, antioxidant, immune, and muscle-building related genes. A total of 250 1-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were divided into five experimental groups (5 replicates/group, 10 birds/replicate) for 42 days as follows: the control group was fed a basal diet and reared in thermoneutral conditions, and the other four HS groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with Resv-Lipo NPsI, II, and III at the levels of 0, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg diet, respectively. The results indicated that supplementation with Resv-Lipo NP improved the growth rate of the HS group. The Resv-Lipo NP group showed the most significant improvement in body weight gain (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and FCR. Additionally, post-HS exposure, the groups that received Resv-Lipo NPs showed restored functions of the kidney and the liver as well as improvements in the lipid profile. The restoration occurred especially at higher levels in the Resv-Lipo NP group compared to the HS group. The elevated corticosterone and T3 and T4 hormone levels in the HS group returned to the normal range in the Resv-Lipo NPsIII group. Additionally, the HS groups supplemented with Resv-Lipo NPs showed an improvement in serum and muscle antioxidant biomarkers. The upregulation of the muscle and intestinal antioxidant-related genes (<i>SOD, CAT, GSH-PX, NR-f2</i>, and <i>HO-1</i>) and the muscle-building genes (myostatin, <i>Myo</i>D, and <i>mTOR</i>) was observed with increasing the level of Resv-Lipo NPs. Heat stress upregulated heat shock proteins (HSP) 70 and 90 gene expression, which was restored to normal levels in HS+Resv-Lipo NPsIII. Moreover, the expression of sirtuin 1, 3, and 7 (<i>SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT7</i>) genes was increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the liver of the HS groups that received Resv-Lipo NPs in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the HS group was restored in the HS groups that received Resv-Lipo NPs. Supplementation with Resv-Lipo NPs can mitigate the harmful impact of HS and consequently improve the performance of broiler chickens.",

At certain intervals (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 h), 12 chickens from each of the 4 groups were humanely euthanized, and liver samples were immediately isolated. During AHS, in both breeds, the mRNA expression levels of NOX4, GPx2, SOD2, and catalase in TM chickens were significantly lower than in controls, but AvUCP mRNA expression in the TM group was higher. The total antioxidant capacity and activity of superoxidase dismutase and catalase were significantly lower in the TM than in the control group in both breeds. The results of this study suggest that TM has a long-lasting effect on the acquisition of thermotolerance in 2 broiler chicken breeds as indicated by the reduction of system genes associated with heat-induced oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "We conducted two trials to evaluate the methionine-sparing effects of choline (Chol) and betaine (Bet), and their effects on growth performance and blood antioxidative potential in heat-stressed broiler chickens fed methionine (Met)-deficient diets. We used 360 1-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308) in a completely randomized study with 5 replicate pens of 12 birds each. After Day 21, we raised the temperature to 35±3°C using an automated air-forced heater for 12 hours/day from 8 am to 8 pm to expose the birds to heat stress. In Trial 1, the treatments comprised a negative control (control-; 1200 mg/kg Met-deficient), a positive control (control+; recommended level of Met), 280Chol (control- plus 280 mg/kg Chol), 560Chol (control- plus 560 mg/kg Chol), 320Bet (control- plus 320 mg/kg Bet), and 640Bet (control- plus 640 mg/kg Bet); and in Trial 2, the treatments comprised a negative control (control-), a positive control (control+), 140Chol+160Bet (control- plus 140 mg/kg Chol and 160 mg/kg Bet), 280Chol+160Bet (controlplus 280 mg/kg Chol and 160 mg/kg Bet), 140Chol+320Bet (control- plus 140 mg/kg Chol and 320 mg/kg Bet), and 280Chol+320Bet (control- plus 280 mg/kg Chol and 320 mg/kg Bet). Compared with the other treatments, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was improved in the 280Chol and control+ groups in Trials 1 and 2 (<i>P</i><0.05). In Trial 2, the cost of meat production for the entire experimental period (1-42 days) was higher in the 140Cho+320Bet-fed birds than in the other birds (<i>P</i><0.05), except the control- birds. Supplementing diets with 280 mg/kg of Chol significantly reduced the serum concentration of uric acid compared with the control+ group (<i>P</i><0.05). Our results indicate that the Met requirements of heat-stressed broiler chickens can be reduced by 20% (1200 mg/kg) if the diet is supplemented with 280 mg/kg of Chol.",

This study investigated the influence of dietary supplementation of <i>Solanum aethiopicum</i> and <i>Solanecio biafrae</i> leaves, which have nutraceutical properties, on stress response, cytokine expression, antioxidant status, blood chemistry, abdominal fat and meat quality in broilers reared in a hot, dry environment.2. One day old, Ross 308 chicks (n = 350) were randomly allotted to basal diets containing either no supplement (D1); 2.5 g/kg <i>Solanum aethiopicum</i> leaf (SAL; D2); 5 g/kg SAL (D3); 2.5 g/kg <i>Solanecio biafrae</i> leaf (SBL; D4); or 5 g/kg SBL (D5) for 42 d. Birds were reared at 34 ± 2°C and 40-50% relative humidity for 6 h/d from 22-42 d. Each dietary group was replicated in seven pens containing 10 chicks.3. In the period 1-21 d, body weight gain, feed efficiency and feed intake were not influenced by diet. At 22-42 and 1-42 d, birds supplemented with SAL and SBL had higher (P < 0.05) body weight gain and feed efficiency than the D1 birds. Cloaca temperature, carcase cuts and relative organ weight did not differ between diets. The D3 birds had higher (P < 0.05) erythrocytes and haemoglobin compared with other birds. Dietary supplements reduced (P < 0.05) mortality, abdominal fat, serum total cholesterol, corticosterone, glucose and blood aspartate aminotransferase levels.4. The treatments up-regulated (P < 0.05) splenic intelukin-10, and down-regulated (P < 0.05) tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β genes. A dose-dependent improvement (P < 0.05) in antioxidant enzyme activities and total antioxidant capacity of serum and breast muscle were found in the supplemented birds. The breast meat of the supplemented birds had lower (P < 0.05) carbonyl and malondialdehyde contents, and higher (P < 0.05) water holding capacity and redness compared with the non-supplemented meat.5. These results illustrated that supplementation with either 5 g/kg SAL or 5 g/kg SBL attenuated the deleterious effects of heat stress in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) has been shown to attenuate the adverse effects of heat stress on broilers, but the mechanisms involving this process remain unclear. We aimed to investigate possible protective mechanisms of Zn on primary cultured hepatocytes of broiler embryos subjected to heat stress. Three experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, hepatocytes were treated with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 μmol/L added Zn as inorganic Zn sulfate (iZn) for 12, 24 or 48 h. In Exp. 2, cells were exposed to 40 °C (a normal temperature [NT]) and 44 °C (a high temperature [HT]) for 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h. In Exp. 3, cells were preincubated with 0 or 50 μmol/L Zn as iZn or organic Zn lysine chelate (oZn) for 8 h under NT, and then incubated with the same Zn treatments under NT or HT for 4 or 6 h. The biomarkers of antioxidative status and heat stress in cells were measured. The results in Exp. 1 indicated that 50 μmol/L Zn and 12 h incubation were the optimal conditions for increasing antioxidant ability of hepatocytes. In Exp. 2, the 4 or 6 h incubation under HT was effective in inducing heat shock responses of hepatocytes. In Exp. 3, HT elevated (<i>P</i> < 0.01) malondialdehyde content and expressions of heat shock protein 70 (<i>HSP70</i>) mRNA and protein, as well as <i>HSP9</i>0 mRNA. However, Zn supplementation increased (<i>P</i> < 0.05) copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) activity and metallothionein mRNA expression, and effectively decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.05) the expressions of <i>HSP7</i>0 mRNA and protein, as well as <i>HSP9</i>0 mRNA. Furthermore, oZn was more effective (<i>P</i> < 0.05) than iZn in enhancing CuZnSOD activity of hepatocytes under HT. It was concluded that Zn (especially oZn) could alleviate heat stress of broiler hepatocytes via enhancing their antioxidant ability and attenuating heat shock responses.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress has been ranked as a critical environmental issue confronting chicken farmers worldwide because of its detrimental effect on the growth, performance and health of the birds. This study evaluated the effects of early-age thermal manipulation (EATC) and supplemental antioxidants on the physiological responses of broilers in a hot tropical environment. A total of 300 day-old Ross broiler chicks were allocated to five thermal and dietary treatments, having 5 replicates of twelve birds each. The treatments were: chicks reared using the conventional method (CC), chicks exposed to early thermal manipulation with a temperature of 38 °C at day 5 with no antioxidant supplementation (TC), TC plus vitamin E at 250 mg/kg of feed (TV), TC plus selenium at 0.5 mg/kg of feed (TS) and the combination of TS and TV(TVS). The experiment was laid out in a Completely Randomized Design and data collected were analyzed using SAS (2008). The results showed that TVS broilers had significantly higher (<i>P</i> < 0.05) body weights at the finisher phase than the other treatment groups. The feed conversion ratio of TVS broilers was comparable to the TV group but lower (<i>P</i> < 0.05) than the other treatments. Reduced levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) of heterophil, lymphocytes and hetrophil and lymphocyte ratio were recorded in the TVS compared to TV, TS and TC broilers. On day 42, the rectal temperature was significantly higher in CC than those in other treatment groups, which were comparable. TVS birds had higher (<i>P</i> < 0.05) weights of spleen, liver and lower abdominal fat than other treatments. The lowest concentration of plasma malondialdehyde and the highest activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were recorded in TV and TVS birds.

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Improving broilers' production in the hot region is essential to overcome heat-stress challenges. The current experiment examined the effects of betaine's fortification (0.0, 0.075, 0.10, and 0.15%) to broiler chickens during days 1-40 of age. The growth period was divided into the starter (1-18 d) and growing-finishing (19-40 d). During the starter period, there was no heat challenge, and all birds were kept under the same conditions. At 18 days of age, half of the birds were kept under thermos-neutral temperature (TN, 22-24 °C), while the other half were kept under high temperature (HT, 35 °C). However, the production efficiency factor (PEF) was the best (<i>p</i> < 0.05) for birds that received 0.10% betaine. Betaine fortification improved (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and 0.01) body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and production efficiency factor (PEF) in the cumulative finisher heat-stress challenge period (19-40 d). The best performance was achieved at 0.1% betaine fortification with 84 g gain, 4.6 points improvement in FCR, and 24 points improvements in PEF as compared to no betaine fortification. The heat-stressed group consumed less feed (239 g), gained less weight (179 g), converted feed less efficiently (2.6 points), and, as a result, had lower FEF (29 points) as compared to the TN group. Conclusively, heat challenge had a powerful effect on growth performance, meat characteristics, and blood parameters, especially during the grower-finisher period. Betaine fortification (0.1%) during heat stress reduced the negative impact on performance and improved production efficiency, suggesting that betaine is a useful nutritional tool under stress conditions that deserves further investigation.",

This experiment investigated the efficacy of a herbal extract mixture (HEM; aqueous extracts from Ferula gummosa, Thymus vulgaris, and Trachyspermum copticum) in day-old chicks, injected intramuscular (deep pectoral muscle; (0, 30, 60, and 90 μL/0.1 mL of sterilized and distilled water)), and supplemented in drinking water (0 and 0.25 mL/L) during the rearing period. Broilers were reared in battery cages under summer temperature conditions, with average maximum temperature of 35.5°C, average minimum temperature of 25.5°C, and average relative humidity of 50-60%. A total of 400 1-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups (5 replicates/treatment with 10 birds per replicate). From d1 to d10, the indoor air temperature was adjusted to match fluctuating outdoor summer temperatures, and was set at 30-34°C and 50-60% relative humidity; and from d10 onwards, no adjustments were made. Injection of HEM linearly decreased feed:gain (P = 0.005), heterophile-to-lymphocyte (H/L) ratio (P = 0.007), and serum concentrations of cholesterol (P = 0.008), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (P < 0.001), malondialdehyde (P = 0.005), and cortisol (P = 0.008). The 60 μL of HEM injection produced the best results in terms of final body weight (BW; P = 0.003), overall average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.002), European performance index (P < 0.001), carcass yield (P < 0.001), and serum glutathione peroxidase activity (P < 0.001). Supplementation of HEM in drinking water also increased final BW (P = 0.048), overall ADG (P = 0.047), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.042), and total antioxidant capacity (P = 0.030), while decreasing the H/L ratio (P = 0.004) and serum LDL concentration (P = 0.031). There were interactions between injection and water supplementation for BW (day 24; P = 0.045), carcass yield (day 42; P = 0.014), and serum superoxide dismutase activity (day 42; P = 0.004). In conclusion, administering an injection of HEM at a dose of 60 μL at the time of hatching, followed by supplementation at a dose of 0.25 mL/L via drinking water during the rearing period could be a useful strategy for improving the performance and health status of heat-stressed broiler chickens.",

A total of 150 one-day-old broiler chicks were divided into 5 groups: (1) NC, negative control; (2) HS, birds exposed to chronic heat stress; (3) HSpBacil, exposed to chronic heat stress and received Bacillus probiotic; (4) HSpLAB, subjected to chronic heat stress and provided with Lactobacillus probiotic; (5) HSpMix, subjected to chronic heat stress and administered a combined probiotic from Bacillus and Lactobacillus. The HS group exhibited significantly reduced levels of growth performance, carcass traits, and notably affected oxidative stress indices, as well as intestinal pH and histomorphology in the birds. Additionally, the administered probiotics led to increased weight of lymphoid organs, enhanced body weight gain, and improved intestinal histomorphology. Furthermore, the probiotics decreased malondialdehyde and increased total antioxidant capacity in broilers. In conclusion, Bacillus and Lactobacillus probiotics, as single or multi-species, particularly Lactobacillus and combined probiotic, demonstrated potential in alleviating the adverse effects of heat stress in broiler chickens.

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) adversely affects several physiological responses in organisms, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are yet to be fully understood. L-Citrulline (L-Cit) is a nutraceutical amino acid that is gaining research interest for its role in body temperature regulation and nitric oxide synthesis. This study investigated whether dietary supplementation with L-Cit (1% of basal diet) could ameliorate the effects of acute HS on thermotolerance, redox balance, and inflammatory responses of broilers. Ross 308 broilers (288 chicks) were subjected to two environments; thermoneutral at 24°C (TNZ) or HS at 35°C for 5 h, and fed two diets; control or L-Cit. The results showed that HS increased the ear, rectal (RT), and core body (CBT) temperatures of broilers, along with higher respiratory rate. The RT and CBT readings were intermittently affected with time effect, whereas, L-Cit supplementation lowered the mean CBT than the control diet. Antioxidant assays showed that superoxide dismutase was increased during HS, while, catalase was promoted by L-Cit supplementation. In addition, L-Cit induced glutathione peroxidase activity compared to the control diet during HS. Hypothalamic heat shock protein (HSP)-90 was upregulated by HS, but L-Cit downregulated heat shock factor (HSF)-1, and HSP 60 mRNA expressions. HSF 3 mRNA expression was downregulated by L-Cit under TNZ condition. More so, HS increased the plasma nitric oxide (NO) concentration but lowered the total NO synthase (tNOS) activity. In contrast, L-Cit supplementation limited NO production but increased the tNOS activity. Arginase activity was increased in the control fed group during HS but L-Cit supplementation lowered this effect. The NOS-COX pathway was significantly affected under TNZ condition, since L-Cit supplementation downregulated the mRNA expression of iNOS-COX2 in the hypothalamus, and further reduced the serum PGE2 concentration. Together, these data indicates that L-Cit influenced the antioxidant defense, heat shock response and nitric oxide regeneration both under thermoneutral and HS conditions; and that L-Cit may be directly and/or indirectly involved in the central regulation of body temperature.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress poses a substantial challenge to poultry production worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for effective management strategies. This study investigated the efficacy of probiotics (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) and ascorbic acid as antistress agents using cloacal and body surface temperatures (CT and BST) as heat stress biomarkers in broiler chickens. A total of 56 broiler chicks were used for the experiment and were divided into four distinct groups: control, probiotics (1 g/kg of feed), ascorbic acid (200 mg/kg of feed) and the combination of probiotics and ascorbic acid (1 g/kg and 200 mg/kg of feed, respectively). The study lasted 35 days; measurements were taken for ambient temperature (AT), CT, and BST. The ambient temperature in the pens consistently exceeded the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) established for broiler chickens. The CT values for broiler chickens in the probiotic group were significantly lower (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to the control group. Additionally, the BST values in the probiotic and probiotic + ascorbic acid groups were significantly lower (<i>p</i> < 0.05) than those in the control group. The findings suggest that incorporating probiotics, with or without ascorbic acid, can effectively reduce CT and BST values in broiler chickens thereby, enhancing thermoregulation when compared to the control group. This implies that using probiotics in poultry diets may enhance health and growth performance, potentially leading to better feed efficiency and reduced reliance on antibiotics. Implementing these dietary strategies could improve the productivity and welfare of broiler chickens in commercial settings.",

Blood samples were collected from 8 birds per treatment weekly for the determination of plasma uric acid, triglycerides, triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) and creatinine kinase. Data obtained were laid out in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Results showed that the final weights of the birds in FD were higher (P < 0.05) than those of the other treatments at the finisher phase. Feed intake of the birds in FD was higher than those of SD3 and TD. FCR of broiler chickens in CT, SD, SD3 and TD was higher than that of FD. The rectal temperature, plasma MDA and blood glucose of the thermally challenged birds in FD was generally better (P < 0.05) than those of the other treatments.

A total of 288 male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly divided into 6 dietary groups (4 replicates and 12 birds/replicate) and supplemented as follows: (I) Normal control (NC) received only basal diet under normal condition. The rest of the animals were challenged with heat and assigned to the following groups: (II) Heat stress control (HSC) received only basal diet; (III) Standard treatment (ST) received basal diet + vit E (100 ppm); (IV-VI) Herbal treatments (HT) received basal diet + 250, 350, and 450 ppm CEO. Heat stress could significantly decrease the animals' performance and induce severe oxidative/nitrosative stress. The HT at the middle dose could significantly improve body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake compared to HSC; however, none of the treatments had a significant effect on feed conversion ratio after inducing heat stress. Moreover, both ST and HT with a trend towards concentration-dependent fashion significantly contributed to normalization of oxidative/nitrosative biomarkers. It appears that CEO is a potential replacement for synthetic antioxidants in broiler diets.",

    "abstract": "Probiotics reduce stress-related inflammation and abnormal behaviors in humans and rodents via regulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The objective of this study was to determine if probiotic, Bacillus subtilis, has similar functions in broiler chickens under heat stress (HS). Two hundred forty 1-d-old broiler chicks were assigned to 48 pens with 4 treatments: Thermoneutral (TN)-RD (regular diet), TN-PD (the regular diet mixed with 1 × 106 CFU/g feed probiotic), HS-RD and HS-PD. Probiotic (Sporulin) was fed from day 1; and HS at 32°C for 10 h daily was initiated at day 15. The data showed that final BW, average daily gain , and feed conversion efficiency were improved in PD groups as compared to RD groups regardless of the ambient temperature (P < 0.01). Heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was affected by treatment and its value was in the order of HS-RD > HS-PD > TN-RD > TN-PD birds (P < 0.01). Compared to TN birds, HS birds spent more time in wing spreading, panting, squatting close to the ground, drinking, sleeping, dozing, and sitting but spent less time in eating, standing, and walking (P < 0.05 or 0.01). In addition, HS birds had greater levels of hepatic IL-6, IL-10, heat shock protein (HSP)70, and HSP70 mRNA expression (P < 0.01) and greater levels of cecal IgA and IgY (P < 0.01) compared to TN birds. Within TN groups, TN-PD birds had greater concentrations of hepatic IL-10 (P < 0.05) and cecal IgA (P < 0.01) than TN-RD birds. Within HS groups, HS-PD birds spent less time in wing spreading, panting, squatting close to the ground, drinking, sleeping, dozing, and sitting but spent more time in eating, foraging, standing, and walking than HS-RD birds (P < 0.05 or 0.01). The HS-PD birds also had lower concentrations of hepatic IL-6 and HSP70 (P < 0.01), whereas greater levels of IL-10 (P < 0.05) and lower concentrations of cecal IgA and IgY (P < 0.01). These results indicate that broilers fed the probiotic, B. subtilis, are able to cope with HS more effectively by ameliorating heat-induced behavioral and inflammatory reactions through regulation of microbiota-modulated immunity.",

    "title": "Effect of a synbiotic supplement as an antibiotic alternative on broiler skeletal, physiological, and oxidative parameters under heat stress.",
    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine if synbiotics can function as alternatives to antibiotics in broiler production under heat stress (HS). Day-old broiler chicks (528 birds) were randomly placed in floor pens within 2 identical temperature-controlled rooms (11 birds/pen and 24 pens/room). The pens of each room were evenly divided among 3 treatments (n = 8): basal diet (CON), the basal diet mixed with 50 ppm of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) or a synbiotic (50 ppm of PoultryStar me<sup>US</sup>, SYN). From d 15, room 2 was under thermoneutral (TN) conditions (TN-CON, TN-BMD, and TN-SYN), while HS was applied to room 1 at 32<sup>o</sup>C for 9 hrs/d (0800 to 1700) (HS-CON, HS-BMD, and HS-SYN). Treatment effects on footpad dermatitis and gait score were measured on 5 birds/pen, and latency to lie (LTL) test was measured on 2 birds/pen at d 27 and d 41; and 1 broiler/pen was sampled on d 28 and d 42, respectively. Body, liver, and spleen weight were determined. Plasma levels of interleukins (IL), heat shock protein 70, immunoglobulin (Ig)Y, liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activities were examined. Heat stress suppressed BW and IgY concentrations on both d 28 and d 42, while suppressed plasma IL-6 concentrations, SOD activities, and LTL duration on d 28 only (P < 0.05). Among all treatments, SYN birds had the best foot and skeletal health scores on both d 27 and d 41 (P < 0.05). On d 42, SYN increased BW, and TN-SYN birds had higher relative spleen weight than both TN-BMD and TN-CON birds (P < 0.05). Antibiotic BMD increased BW (P < 0.05) but decreased SOD activities (P < 0.05) on d 42. These results indicate that the SYN supplementation decreases HS negative effect on broilers by improving BW, foot, and skeletal health, while BMD improves BW but also increases oxidative stress in broilers. The data suggest that synbiotic supplement may function as an alternative to antibiotics in broiler production during summer seasons, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of dietary resveratrol supplementation on growth performance, rectal temperature, and serum parameters of yellow-feather broilers under heat stress. A total of 480 yellow-feather broilers (28-day-old) were randomly allotted to five groups with six replicates. A thermoneutral group (TN) (24 ± 2°C) received a basal diet and another four heat-stressed groups (37 ± 2°C for 8 hr/day and 24 ± 2°C for the remaining time) were fed the basal diet or basal diet with 200, 350, and 500 mg/kg resveratrol for 14 consecutive days. The results revealed that resveratrol supplementation improved average daily gain (p = 0.001), and decreased (p < 0.05) rectal temperature from d 3 when compared with heat-stressed group without resveratrol. In addition, supplementation with resveratrol at 350 or 500 mg/kg lowered (p < 0.05) the contents of corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, malonaldehyde, and activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase, increased (p < 0.05) the levels of triiodothyronine, the ratio of triiodothyronine to thyroxine, total protein, glutathione, and activities of alkaline phosphatase, total superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, though with few fluctuation. In conclusion, supplementation with resveratrol can improve the growth performance by positively regulating serum metabolic parameters and alleviating tissue oxidant damage of broilers under heat stress.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "The spleen is the largest peripheral immune organ of the organism, accounting for 25% of the total lymphoid tissue of the body. During HS, the spleen is damaged due to the elevated environment, which seriously affects life performance and broilers' health. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of chronic HS damage to broiler spleen tissues. The broilers were typically raised until they reached 21 days of age, after which they were arbitrarily allocated into two groups: an HS group and a cntrol group. The HS group was subjected to a temperature of 35 °C for 10 h each day, starting at 21 days of age. At 35 and 42 days of age, spleen and serum samples were obtained from the broilers. The results showed that after HS, a significant decrease in productive performance was observed at 42 days of age (<i>p</i> < 0.01), and the spleen index, and bursa index were significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.01). T-AOC of the organism was significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05), GSH-PX, SOD, and CAT antioxidant factors were significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.01), and MDA was significantly elevated (<i>p</i> < 0.01). HS also led to a significant increase in cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and INF-γ and a significant decrease in IL-4 in the spleen. The histopathologic results showed that the spleen's red-white medulla was poorly demarcated. The cells were sparsely arranged after HS. After HS, the expression of TLRs, MYD88, and NF-κB genes increased significantly. The expression of HSP70 increased significantly, suggesting that HS may induces an inflammatory response in broiler spleens through this signaling pathway, which may cause pathological damage to broiler spleens, leading to a decrease in immune function and progressively aggravating HS-induced damage with the prolongation of HS.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "One thousand two hundred male broilers were used to evaluate the effect of different dosages of HiZox® on feed efficiency, growth performance and bone quality of broilers suffering from heat stress. A completely randomized design was used, with four treatments and ten replicates. Basal corn−soybean meal diets supplemented with 75, 100 and 125 mg/kg zinc from HiZox and 100 mg/kg zinc from regular ZnO were used to make four treatments. Heat stress was induced after the third week by keeping house temperature between 28−34 °C, from 1 pm until 5 pm. The body weights of the birds that received the diet supplemented with HiZox or ZnO showed no significant difference at 7 and 14 days. Body weight of heat stressed birds fed diets containing different levels of HiZox or ZnO were not different at 28 and 42 days of age. In comparison to the Ross 308 management guide, induced heat stress diminished body weight and feed intake by approximately 17 and 21%, respectively. At 28 days, chickens who received 125 mg/kg Zn from Hizox had better feed efficiency (p < 0.05). The mortality rate of heat-stressed male broiler chickens who received different dosages of HiZox was 2.85% less than that of the regular ZnO group (p < 0.06). The results showed that addition of HiZox to the diet of male broiler under heat stress doubled the skin resistance during feather plucking in the slaughter plant and improved carcass quality (p < 0.07). Tibia breaking strength, included elongation and extension were improved by consumption of a diet supplemented with 75 mg HiZox/kg (p < 0.09). The HiZox-75 fed broilers required higher amounts of energy (MJ) for tibia breaking at break and peak points at 42 days (p < 0.09; p < 0.07). Jejunum Zn concentrations reflected the quantity of ingested Zn (p < 0.0001). Gizzard Zn solubility was dependent on dietary treatment (p < 0.03). Solubility of Zn in the gizzard of chickens who received HiZox was higher (about 30%) than broilers fed regular ZnO. In conclusion, Zn from HiZox was more efficient in decreasing heat stress mortality, increasing skin resistance and bone breaking strength compared to a regular ZnO source.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the comparative effects of dietary functional nutrients including glutamine (Gln), chromium picolinate (Cr picolinate), vitamin C (Vit C), betaine (Bet), and taurine (Tau) on growth performance, meat quality, immune responses, and stress biomarkers in broiler chickens raised under heat stress conditions. A total of 420 21-d-old Ross 308 male broiler chickens (initial body weight = 866±61.9 g) were randomly allotted to 1 of 7 treatment groups with 6 replicates. One group was kept under thermoneutral conditions and was fed a basal diet (PC, positive control). Other 6 groups were exposed to a cyclic heat stress condition. One of the 6 groups was fed the basal diet (NC, negative control), whereas 5 other groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.5% Gln, 500 ppb Cr picolinate, 250 mg/kg Vit C, 0.2% Bet, or 1.0% Tau. The diets and water were provided ad libitum for 21 d. Broiler chickens in NC group had decreased (p<0.05) growth performance and immune responses measured based on cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH), but increased (p<0.05) stress responses measured based on feather corticosterone concentrations and blood heterophil:lymphocyte than those in PC group. However, none of dietary functional nutrients had a positive effect on growth performance of broiler chickens. Dietary supplementation of 250 mg/kg Vit C improved (p<0.05) CBH responses of broiler chickens, but other functional nutrients had no such an improvement in CBH responses. All functional nutrients decreased (p<0.05) stress responses of broiler chickens. Functional nutrients including Gln, Cr picolinate, Vit C, Bet, and Tau at the supplemental levels used in this study decrease stress responses of broiler chickens to a relatively similar extent. However, this reduction in stress responses could not fully ameliorate decreased productive performance of broiler chickens raised under the current heat stress conditions.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Identification of alternatives to antibiotics in livestock and poultry is necessary. Fueled by consumer preferences, phytogenic feed additives are increasingly used in the food system; however, their mode of action is not well defined. Here, we used broiler chickens, in which appetite and feeding behavior regulation are controlled by complex mechanisms, to determine the effect of the phytogenic feed additive \"comfort\" (PFA-C) as well as its underlying molecular mechanisms on growth performance in heat-stressed broiler chickens. Heat stress significantly increased birds' core body temperature, water intake, and the hypothalamic expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 70, whereas it decreased feed intake, BW, and woody breast incidence. Phytogenic feed additive \"comfort\" supplementation downregulated the hypothalamic expression of HSP70, reduced core body temperature, increased feed and water intake, and improved BW in HS broilers. At molecular levels, the effect of PFA-C on growth performance seemed to be mediated by modulation of hypothalamic expression of melanocortin receptor 2, arginine vasopressin, aquaporin 2, and sodium and potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta 1 polypeptides. In summary, PFA-C supplementation ameliorates heat stress productivity losses via a potential cytoprotective effect, reduction of hypothalamic intracellular stress, and modulation of hypothalamic feeding- and drinking-related polypeptide expression.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented rate of global warming requires more immaculate strategies to fight the heat stress and its detrimental effects on poultry sector. Nutritional strategies, particularly herbal extracts, play a crucial importance in this scenario. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a novel selected mixture (hereafter refers to as Stress-Bio-Max, SBM) comprising St John's wort, lavender, Melissa officinalis extracts, betaine, and Vit C on heat-stressed broilers. A total of 300 male broiler chicks were allocated to 4 treatments: T1, Control (no SBM in drinking water); T2, 0.25 mL/L of SBM in drinking water; T3, 0.5 and T4, 1 mL/L of SBM, which applied since d 32. The birds underwent heat stress (40 ± 1) daily from d 35 to 42 of the experiment (2 pm-8 pm). The results show the superior weight gain of T2 and T3 from d 7 to 42 compared to other groups, 72.5 and 72.7 g/d, respectively (P < 0.05). Corticosterone level was higher on d 35 in T1 (4.674 ng/mL, P < 0.05) and lower in T2 and T3 (2.64 and 2.952 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.05); T2 and T3 also caused the lowest concentrations of corticosterone on d 40 (5.198 and 6.458 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.05). The superior triiodothyronine levels belonged to T2 (0.935 ng/mL, P < 0.05) on d 35 and T2 and T3 on d 40 (0.699 and 0.582 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.05). T2, T3, and T4 caused a rise in glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (P < 0.05). A significant higher amount of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) belonged to the groups treating with SBM (P < 0.05). The SBM in T2 and T3 resulted in the lowest levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Results from this study indicate that SBM may alleviate the negative impacts associated with heat stress in broiler chickens.",

A total of 252 male broilers Cobb 500 were allocated in cages in environmentally controlled chambers. All the broilers received the same basal diet from 1 to 21 d. On day 22, the broilers were weighed and grouped into 7 treatment groups and exhibited to cyclic high temperature at 36 ± 1°C for 3 h per day until the end of the experiment. From day 22 to 42, broilers were fed with one of the 7 following diets: negative control, basal diet (0.0% RI11) (NC group); positive control, NC diet + 0.02% (w/w) oxytetracycline (OTC group); antioxidant control, NC diet + 0.02% (w/w) ascorbic acid. The other 4 other groups were as follows: NC diet + 0.2% cell-free supernatant (postbiotic RI11) (v/w), NC diet + 0.4% cell-free supernatant (postbiotic RI11) (v/w), NC diet + 0.6% cell-free supernatant (postbiotic RI11) (v/w), and NC diet + 0.8% cell-free supernatant (postbiotic RI11) (v/w). Supplementation of different levels (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8%) of postbiotic RI11 increased plasma glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione enzyme activity. Postbiotic RI11 groups particularly at levels of 0.4 and 0.6% upregulated the mRNA expression of IL-10 and downregulated the IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, heat shock protein 70, and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein levels compared with the NC and OTC groups. Feeding postbiotic RI11, particularly at the level of 0.6%, upregulated ileum zonula occludens-1 and mucin 2 mRNA expressions. However, no difference was observed in ileum claudin 1, ceruloplasmin, IL-6, IL-2, and interferon expression, but downregulation of occludin expression was observed as compared with the NC group. Supplementation of postbiotic RI11 at different levels quadratically increased plasma glutathione peroxidase, catalase and glutathione, IL-10, mucin 2, and zonula occludens-1 mRNA expression and reduced plasma IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and heat shock protein 70 mRNA expression. The results suggested that postbiotics produced from Lactiplantibacillus plantarum RI11 especially at the level of 0.6% (v/w) could be used as an alternative to antibiotics and natural sources of antioxidants in poultry feeding.",

Broilers aged 35 d were randomly assigned to 3 groups: control and HS groups fed the basic normal diet, and the HEHA group fed the HEHA diet (basal diet + 100 kcal/kg AME + 15 % DAAs). The HS and HEHA groups were exposed to cyclic HS (30 ± 1 to 34 ± 1 ℃) for 2 wk, while the control group was maintained at 26 ± 1 ℃. The results indicated that the HEHA diet significantly alleviated HS-induced feed intake and body weight loss. HEHA feeding mitigated the increase in body temperature during HS. Compared with observations in the HS group, the HEHA diet reduced the levels of ALT, Alb, and corticosterone in the serum and downregulated the gene expression of HSP27 and HSP60 in the liver. Moreover, the HEHA group showed higher GSH-px activity in the serum and SOD and GSH-Px activity in the jejunal mucosa than that of the HS group. HEHA supplementation also reduced MDA levels in the liver. In conclusion, the HEHA diet improved the production performance of broilers under HS by increasing their antioxidant capacities. These findings suggest an effective strategy to combat HS in poultry production.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to high ambient temperature has been shown to impair growth performance and to cause oxidative stress in broilers. This study investigated the hypothesis that supplementation with methionine (Met) as DL-Met (DLM) more than the National Research Council recommendations improves growth performance and alleviates oxidative stress in broilers exposed to high ambient temperature. One-day-old male Cobb-500 broilers (n = 68) were allotted to 4 groups and phase-fed 3 basal diets during days 1 to 10, 11 to 21, and 22 to 35. One group was kept under thermoneutral temperature conditions and received the basal diets with Met + cysteine (Cys) concentrations according to recommendations of NRC. The other 3 groups were kept in a room with an increased ambient temperature from week 3 to 5 and were fed either the basal diet or the basal diets supplemented with 2 levels of DLM in which Met + Cys concentrations exceeded NRC recommendations by around 20% (group DLM1) and 40% (group DLM2), respectively. As expected, the broilers exposed to high ambient temperature showed a lower feed intake, lower body weight gains, a higher feed:gain ratio, and biochemical indications of oxidative stress in comparison to broilers kept under thermoneutral temperature conditions. Supplementation of DLM did not improve the growth performance in broilers exposed to high ambient temperature. However, the broilers supplemented with DLM had increased concentrations of glutathione in liver and breast muscle (groups DLM1 and DLM2), increased concentrations of tocopherols in the liver (group DLM2), and reduced concentrations of 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol in heat-processed thigh muscle (groups DLM1 and DLM2) in comparison to the control group exposed to high ambient temperature. Concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and vitamin C in plasma, liver, and muscle were not different between the 3 groups exposed to heat stress. Nevertheless, the study shows that supplementation of DLM in slight excess of the Met concentration required for maximum growth performance improved the antioxidant status in tissues and reduced the susceptibility of muscle toward oxidation in heat-stressed broilers.",

After 2 weeks of acclimation, birds were subjected into four groups (9 pens/group) including (1) a normal-protein diet under TN (ambient temperature), (2) an LP diet under TN, (3) a normal-protein diet under HS (35 °C for 7 h/day), and (4) an LP diet under HS, for 4 weeks. During HS, but not TN, LP tended to decrease FI, which might be associated with a lower mRNA abundance of duodenal ghrelin and higher GIP during HS. The LP group had a higher thermal radiation than NP under TN, but during HS, the LP group had a lower thermal radiation than NP. This was linked with higher a transcript of muscle β1AR and AMPKα1 during TN, but not HS. Further, LP increased the gene expression of COX IV during TN but reduced COX IV and the sirtuin 1 abundance during HS. The dietary protein content differentially impacted plasma metabolome during TN and HS with divergent changes in amino acids such as tyrosine and tryptophan. Compared to NP, LP had increased abundances of <i>p_Tenericutes</i>, <i>c_Mollicutes</i>, <i>c_Mollicutes_RF9</i>, and <i>f_tachnospiraceae</i> under HS. Overall, LP diets may mitigate the negative outcome of heat stress on the survivability of birds by reducing FI and heat production. The differential effect of an LP diet on energy balance during TN and HS is likely regulated by gut and skeletal muscle and alterations in plasma metabolites and cecal microbiota.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Intestinal oxidative stress in broilers is produced by chronic heat stress (HS) and has a negative impact on poultry performance as it induces intestinal inflammation and promotes the invasion of gram-negative bacteria, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, dietary inclusion of the antioxidant compound, ethoxyquin (EQ), could improve enteric antioxidant capacity, immune responses, and the epithelial barrier, and maintain the symbiotic gut microbiota community. To investigate the effects of EQ supplementation on alleviating enteric oxidative stress in heat-stressed broilers, 200 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 50 chicks/group; n = 10 chicks/replicate) and fed a basal diet supplemented with 0 (CT), 50 (EQ-50), 100 (EQ-100), and 200 (EQ-200) mg EQ/ kg<sup>-1</sup> for 5 wk. The chicks were raised in floor pens inside the broiler farm at a temperature and humidity index (THI) of 29 from d 21 to d 35. Growth performance traits, relative organ index, hepatic antioxidant enzymes, serum immunity, total adenylate, and cytokine activities were improved in the EQ-50 group (linear or quadratic P < 0.05), promoting the relative mRNA expression of cytokine gene-related anti-inflammatory and growth factors. A distinct microbial community colonised the gut microbiota in the EQ-50 group, with a high relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Ligilactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Pediococcus, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium compared to the other groups. Dietary supplementation with 50 mg EQ/ kg<sup>-1</sup> for 5 wk attenuates enteric oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation by enhancing serum immune and cytokine content (IgG, IL-6, and TGF-β,) and symbiotic microbiota in heat-stressed broilers. EQ promotes the expression of Hsp70, SOD2, GPx 4, IL-6, and IGF-1 cytokine gene-related anti-inflammatory and growth factors in heat-stressed hepatic broilers. Collectively, EQ-50 could be a suitable feed supplement for attenuating enteric oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation, thereby promoting the productivity of heat-stressed broilers.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "With climate change, selection for water efficiency and heat resilience are vitally important. We undertook this study to determine the effect of chronic cyclic heat stress (HS) on the hypothalamic expression profile of water homeostasis-associated markers in high (HWE)- and low (LWE)-water efficient chicken lines. HS significantly elevated core body temperatures of both lines. However, the amplitude was higher by 0.5-1°C in HWE compared to their LWE counterparts. HWE line drank significantly less water than LWE during both thermoneutral (TN) and HS conditions, and HS increased water intake in both lines with pronounced magnitude in LWE birds. HWE had better feed conversion ratio (FCR), water conversion ratio (WCR), and water to feed intake ratio. At the molecular level, the overall hypothalamic expression of aquaporins (AQP8 and AQP12), arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its related receptor AVP2R, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), and calbindin 2 (CALB2) were significantly lower; however, CALB1 mRNA and AQP2 protein levels were higher in HWE compared to LWE line. Compared to TN conditions, HS exposure significantly increased mRNA abundances of AQPs (8, 12), AVPR1a, natriuretic peptide A (NPPA), angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), CALB1 and 2, and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 and 4 (TRPV1 and TRPV4) as well as the protein levels of AQP2, however it decreased that of AQP4 gene expression. A significant line by environment interaction was observed in several hypothalamic genes. Heat stress significantly upregulated AQP2 and SCT at mRNA levels and AQP1 and AQP3 at both mRNA and protein levels, but it downregulated that of AQP4 protein only in LWE birds. In HWE broilers, however, HS upregulated the hypothalamic expression of renin (REN) and AVPR1b genes and AQP5 proteins, but it downregulated that of AQP3 protein. The hypothalamic expression of AQP (5, 7, 10, and 11) genes was increased by HS in both chicken lines. In summary, this is the first report showing improvement of growth performances in HWE birds. The hypothalamic expression of several genes was affected in a line- and/or environment-dependent manner, revealing potential molecular signatures for water efficiency and/or heat tolerance in chickens.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "The thymus, a central lymphoid organ in animals, serves as the site for T cell development, differentiation and maturation, vital to adaptive immunity. The thymus is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis to protect against tumors and tissue damage. An overactive or prolonged immune response can lead to oxidative stress from increased production of reactive oxygen species. Heat stress induces oxidative stress and overwhelms the natural antioxidant defense mechanisms. This study's objectives were to investigate the protective properties of astaxanthin against heat-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the chicken thymus, by comparing the growth performance and gene signaling pathways among three groups: thermal neutral, heat stress, and heat stress with astaxanthin. The thermal neutral temperature was 21-22 °C, and the heat stress temperature was 32-35 °C. Both heat stress groups experienced reduced growth performance, while the astaxanthin-treated group showed a slightly lesser decline. The inflammatory response and antioxidant defense system were activated by the upregulation of the <i>NF-kB</i>, <i>NFE2L2</i>, <i>PPARα</i>, cytoprotective capacity, and apoptotic gene pathways during heat stress compared to the thermal neutral group. However, expression levels showed no significant differences between the thermal neutral and heat stress with antioxidant groups, suggesting that astaxanthin may mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress damage.",

This study examined the effect of dietary inclusion of probiotic (PRO), citric acid (CIT), garlic powder (GAR) or their combinations on growth, blood constituents, ileal microflora and morphology and humoral immunity of broiler chickens subjected to cyclic heat stress. Four hundred ninety one-day-old Ross-308 broiler chicks were randomly allocated to 7 groups with 7 replicates of 10 birds each as follows: control (C) group received the basal diet without supplements, PRO, CIT and GAR groups supplemented with 0.5 g kg<sup>-1</sup> multi-strain probiotic mixture (MPM), citric acid and garlic powder, respectively. PRO-CIT and PRO-GAR groups treated with 0.5 g kg<sup>-1</sup> MPM, and 0.5 g kg<sup>-1</sup> citric acid and garlic powder, while CIT-GAR group fed diet with 0.5 g kg<sup>-1</sup> of citric acid and garlic powder. Results revealed that dietary supplements and their combinations improved (P < 0.001) growth performance and decreased abdominal fat of heat-stressed birds. Dietary supplements decreased (P < 0.01) serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, while HDL was elevated (P < 0.05). Feed additives reduced (P < 0.01) ileal enumeration of Escherichia coli and total coliform while Lactobacillus count was increased (P < 0.05) only in MPM-enriched groups. Supplementation of these natural products improved (P < 0.01) ileal architecture while humoral immune response was not significantly influenced except antibody titre against Newcastle disease virus which was increased (P < 0.05) in MPM-supplemented groups. Conclusively, addition of the dietary supplements and their combinations, particularly, probiotic and citric acid combination can improve productive performance, and intestinal flora and histomorphometry of broilers exposed to cyclic heat stress.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Viola yedoensis Makino (VYM) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine widely distributed in China. It has many pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, immune regulation and anti-oxidation. However, the protective effect of VYM on the spleen and thymus of broilers induced by heat stress has rarely been reported. We established a heat stress model of broilers to explore the protective effect of VYM on spleen and thymus of broilers. In this experiment, a heat stress model was made by adjusting the feeding temperature of broilers. The protective effect of VYM on the spleen and thymus of heat-stressed broilers were evaluated by detecting immune organ coefficient, histological observation, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, production of antioxidant enzymes and peroxides, TUNEL Staining, Quantitative Real-time PCR. In this study, 60 healthy male AA broilers were divided into 6 groups: Control, 4.5% VYM, HS, HS + 0.5% VYM, HS + 1.5% VYM, HS + 4.5% VYM. After 42 days of feeding, serum, spleen and thymus were collected for detection and analysis. The study revealed that heat stress can lead to pathological damage in the spleen and thymus of broilers, reduce the content of immunoglobulin and newcastle disease (ND), infectious bursal disease (IBD) antibody levels, increase the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β, INF-γ, heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70), heat shock 90 kDa protein (HSP90). Heat stress inhibits the activity of antioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD, promotes the production of MDA, and then lead to oxidative damage of the spleen and thymus. In addition, apoptotic cells and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was increased. However, the addition of VYM to the feed can alleviate the adverse effects of heat stress on the spleen and thymus of broilers. This study showed that the addition of VYM to the diet could inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis, and reduce the inflammatory damage of heat stress on the spleen and thymus of broilers. This study provides a basis for further exploring the regulatory role of VYM in heat stress-induced immune imbalance in broilers. In addition, this study also provides a theoretical basis for the development of VYM as a feed additive with immunomodulatory effects.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to enhance the knowledge about the effects of hydrolyzed yeast supplementation on growth performance, woody breast myopathy, and its mechanism on intestinal homeostasis using antioxidant and immunomodulatory-related gene expressions in heat-stressed broiler chickens. In a 35-d feeding experiment, 160-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chickens were assigned to four dietary groups, consisting of eight replicates and five birds per replicate. Experimental diets contained four levels of hydrolyzed yeast (HY) (0, 400, 800, or 1,200 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>) derived from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. On d 25, birds were exposed to cyclic heat stress (HS) (35°C for 8 h/d from 8 a.m. to 4.00 p.m.) for 10 days. Adding HY at 800 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> numerically decreased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) on days 25-35 (heat stress period) by 2.50%. Furthermore, the addition of HY reduced (<i>P</i> = 0.005) mortality rate compared with those of birds fed the control diet. Supplementation of HY exhibited efficacy (<i>P</i> = 0.09) in diminishing woody breast (WB) in terms of incidence and degree of severity. Furthermore, the added HY decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.001) drip loss values of the <i>Pectoralis major</i> compared with the control diet group; the addition of HY at 400 and 1,200 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.001) cooking loss values in the <i>Pectoralis major</i>. In addition, HY supplementation at 800 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> decreased (<i>P</i> = 0.04) the duodenal mRNA expression of the avian β-defensin 10 (AvBD10) and increased (<i>P</i> < 0.05) the mRNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA). The addition of HY at 400 and 800 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> decreased (<i>P</i> = 0.001) the duodenal mRNA expression of copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD1). HY supplementation tended to decrease (<i>P</i> =0.07) the duodenal mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). The results suggest that hydrolyzed yeast supplementation to broiler chickens exposed to heat stress might improve intestinal redox homeostasis and decrease the mortality rate. The inclusion of 800 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> HY in the diet enhanced duodenal redox homeostasis, while 400-1,200 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> HY reduced mortality rate and exhibited lower drip loss values and reduced woody breast of <i>Pectoralis major</i> in terms of incidence and degree of severity.",

An experimental study was conducted to perform Comparative analysis of Selenium yeast with inorganic Se in broilers under heat stress. A total of 120 broilers chicks of one day were assigned to 4 groups each consisting 30 chicks fed on same basal diet but different selenium sources. The basal diet of group D1 was not supplemented with Se source (Negative control), group D2 basal diet was supplemented with inorganic selenium (Sodium selenite 0.22mg/Kg starter phase and 0.15mg/Kg finisher phase), group D3 basal diet was supplemented with commercially available organic selenium (Seleno-methionine 0.22mg/Kg starter phase and 0.15mg/Kg finisher phase) and group D4 basal diet was supplemented with self-developed organic selenium (Se-enriched yeast 0.22mg/Kg starter phase and 0.15mg/Kg finisher phase). The performance parameters i.e. feed intake (FI), live body weight (BW) and FCR were not significantly (p>0.05) effected by selenium supplementation in the starter phase but were significantly (p<0.05) effected in the finisher phase. Selenium supplementation significantly (p<0.05) effected serum Se level in different supplemented groups. Higher serum Se value (58.20±0.06) was recorded in D4 group. Similarly significantly lower selenium value was recorded for D4 and higher was recorded for D1 (11.36±0.08). However lower serum Paraoxonase (PON) value was recorded for D4 (13.24±0.01) and higher for D1 (13.33±0.03). Comparatively self-developed Se enriched yeast increased the Se accumulation and improved antioxidant system. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was found higher in D4 (12.333±0.03) followed by D3, D2 and D1 respectively. Whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower (p<0.05) in D4 (0.1437±0.003) followed by D3 (0.1457±0.002). Selenium supplementation increased the bird's survival rate. Birds fed on Se enriched yeast showed higher Se deposition and better antioxidant capacity as compared to other sources of selenium. Se-enriched yeast displayed an improved result on Se deposition in tissues, and oxidative capacity, meat tenderness and immune response level as compared to other sources of selenium.",

In total, 100 one-day-old chicks were divided into two equal groups of five replicates. At 22 days of age and thereafter, the first group (TN) was maintained at a thermoneutral condition (23 ± 1 °C), while the second group (TS) was subjected to 8 h of thermal stress (34 °C). The heat-stressed group showed significantly lower ADFI but higher FCR than the thermoneutral group (<i>p</i> = 0.030 and 0.041, respectively). The TS group showed significantly higher serum cholesterol, ALT, and AST (<i>p =</i> 0.033, 0.024, and 0.010, respectively). Meanwhile, the TS group showed lower serum total proteins, albumin, globulin, and Na+ than the TN group (<i>p</i> = 0.001, 0.025, 0.032, and 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the TS group showed significantly lower SOD and catalase in heart tissues (<i>p</i> = 0.005 and 0.001, respectively). The TS group showed significantly lower liver ATP than the TN group (<i>p</i> = 0.005). Meanwhile, chronic thermal stress significantly increased the levels of ADP and AMP in the liver tissues of broiler chickens (<i>p</i> = 0.004 and 0.029, respectively). The TS group showed significantly lower brain serotonin (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and liver CoQ10 (<i>p</i> = 0.001) than the TN group. It could be concluded that thermal stress disturbed the antioxidant defense system and energy metabolism and exhausted ATP levels in the liver tissues of broiler chickens.

    "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary nanoselenium supplementation at 0, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg of diet on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, immune response, antioxidant capacity, and jejunal morphology of 29-d-old male broilers subjected to heat stress at 37 ± 1°C for 14 d. Broilers were fed for 42 d on the experimental diets. The results showed that nanoselenium supplementation had no effect on growth performance, but it supplementation at the rate of 1.2 mg/kg diet decreased the serum concentration of cholesterol prior to the heat exposure. Further, dietary nanoselenium supplementation linearly increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, while linearly decreased those of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and aspartate aminotransferase in the serum before applying heat stress. Compared with thermoneutral temperature, heat stress reduced body mass gain, feed intake, percentages of carcass, breast, leg, abdominal fat, bursa of Fabricius, thymus, antibody response against sheep red blood cells, serum concentration of protein, erythrocyte activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, jejunal villus height, and villus height to crypt depth ratio, while increased feed conversion ratio, percentages of liver, gizzard, pancreas, gallbladder, heart, and the concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and malondialdehyde. Dietary supplementation of nanoselenium linearly reduced the abdominal fat and liver percentages, while linearly increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase and villus height in heat-stressed broilers. Furthermore, the lower level of nanoselenium decreased the percentages of gizzard and heart in broilers under heat stress. The diet supplemented with 1.2 mg/kg nanoselenium improved feed conversion ratio and increased antibody response against sheep red blood cells, activity of superoxide dismutase, and villus height to crypt depth ratio, but decreased the serum concentrations of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and malondialdehyde in heat-stressed broilers. The results suggest that supplemental nanoselenium improved growth performance, internal organs health, immune response, and jejunal morphology by alleviating the oxidative stress induced by heat stress.",

Three hundred 1-d-old Cobb broiler chicks were randomly allocated into five treatments, each treatment contained six replicates (10 birds/replicate). Treatment 1 (-Control) was fed a basal diet (BD) under thermo-neutral conditions between d 1 and 42 of age. Treatment 2 (+Control) also fed the BD under thermo-neutral conditions from d 1 to 28 of age, followed by exposure to cyclic heat stress (HS; 36°C between 0900 and 1700 h, then to 24°C between 1700 and 0900 h daily) during the fifth week. During the fifth week, Treatments 3, 4, and 5 underwent the same HS regime and fed the same BD containing 15g/kg of thyme oil (TO), cinnamon oil (CO), and pomegranate oil (PO) from d 1 to 42, respectively. Compared to the thermoneutral control, HS control exhibited lower ADFI, higher FCR, increased mortality rate, altered plasma biochemicals, and reduced anti-oxidant capacity. Broilers supplemented with PO showed a 14.4 % increase in final BW and a 25.8 % in ADG during recovery period. FCR was improved by 16.9 %, and mortality dropped to 6 % compared to 10 % in the HS control, suggesting reduced losses under heat stress. TO and CO treatments also showed beneficial effects compared to the HS control group. The supplemented feed additives decreased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and malondialdehyde content, while increasing plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and total antioxidant capacity relative to the HS control. TO, CO, and PO treatments exhibited higher plasma superoxide dismutase activity compared to the HS control. All supplemented treatments showed lower H/L ratio compared to HS control (P < 0.05). The PO and TO treatments exhibited an increased jejunal villus/crypt ratio relative to the control groups. In conclusion, supplementing broiler diets with PO, TO, and CO can alleviate heat stress effects, improve growth performance, and potentially boost profitability for poultry farmers, with PO providing the most significant benefits in both thermoneutral and heat stress conditions.",

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the growth performance and antioxidant capacity of 35-d-old broilers exposed to heat stress. Broilers, 14 d of age, were divided into four groups with six replicates per group (eight chickens/replicate). Thermoneutral group (Group TN) was fed the basal diet and maintained at 28°C for 24 h/d. The heat-stressed groups were housed at 35°C for 12 h/d and 28°C for 12 h/d and fed the basal diet supplemented with EGCG at 0, 300 and 600 mg/kg diet (Groups HS0, HS 300 and HS600, respectively). Compared with Group TN, heat-stressed groups showed significantly reduced gain, feed intake and serum total protein and glucose levels; inhibited serum alkaline phosphatase activities; and increased serum levels of uric acid, cholesterol and triglycerides and the activity of serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase (p < 0.05). Compared with Group HS0, Group HS600 exhibited an increased gain and feed intake; and normalised blood parameters and enzyme activities. Compared with Group TN, the expression of antioxidant-related liver proteins was decreased in Group HS0 and increased in Groups HS300 and HS600 (p < 0.05). The results suggest that EGCG can improve the growth performance and alleviate the oxidant damage by modulating the antioxidant properties of broilers.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine if synbiotics present similar efficiency to a common antibiotic used in poultry production under heat stress (HS) conditions. Two hundred and forty-one-day-old male Ross 708 broiler chicks were distributed among 3 treatments with 8 pens per treatment of 80 birds each for a 42-day trial. From day 15, birds were heat stressed (32°C for 9 h daily, HS) and fed the basal diet (CONT), the basal diet mixed with an antibiotic (Bactiracin Methylene Disalicylate) (0.05 g/kg of feed, BMD) or a synbiotic (0.5 g/kg of feed, SYN). The treatment effects on bird behavior, production performance, jejunal histomorphology, and cecal microbial ecology were examined. Behavioral observation was recorded by using instantaneous scan sampling technique. Production parameters were measured on day 14, 28, and 42. Cecal microbial populations of Escherichia coli and Lactobacilli and jejunal histomorphological parameters were measured at day 42. The results showed that, SYN birds exhibited more feeding and preening but less drinking and panting behaviors compared with both BMD and CONT birds (P < 0.05). The SYN birds also had higher body weight (BW) at both day 28 and 42 compared to CONT birds (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, the counts of Escherichia coli of SYN birds were at the similar levels of BMD but were lower than that of CONT birds (P < 0.05); while there were no treatment effects on the populations of Lactobacilli (P > 0.05). In addition, SYN birds had greater villus height compared with both CONT and BMD birds (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that the dietary synbiotic supplement has significant performance and welfare benefits, with the potential to be used as an alternative to antibiotics for poultry meat production, especially during hot seasons.",

    "abstract": "This research was executed to study the impacts of adding betaine (BT) to broiler diets on intestinal inflammatory response and barrier integrity under heat stress (HS). At 21 d of age, 150 male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups: control (CON) group, in which broilers were provided standard finisher feed under thermoneutral condition (22 ± 1°C); HS group and HS + BT group, in which broilers were given the standard feed supplied with 0 and 1,000 mg/kg BT, respectively, under cyclic HS condition (33 ± 1°C for 8 h from 08:00 to 16:00 h and the thermoneutral temperature for the residual hours). Each treatment was replicated ten times with 5 broilers per replicate. The HS group showed an elevation (P < 0.05) in serum corticosterone (CORT) concentration, D-lactate acid (D-LA) content, and diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, mucosal interleukin-1β (IL-1β) level, and expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene, and a reduction (P < 0.05) in mucosal interleukin-10 (IL-10) level and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) content and relative abundance of mRNA for occludin (OCLN), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1 (CLDN1), and claudin-4 (CLDN4). In contrast, broilers in the HS + BT group exhibited a raise (P < 0.05) in mucosal IL-10 level and SIgA content and relative expression of OCLN and ZO-1 genes, and a decline (P < 0.05) in serum CORT concentration and DAO activity, mucosal IL-1β level, and expression of HSP70 mRNA. These results indicate that supplemental BT can ameliorate intestinal injury in heat-challenged broilers by suppressing inflammatory responses and enhancing mucosal barrier function.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the supplemental effects of the flavonoids genistein and hesperidin for biomarkers of heat stress in broilers reared under persistent summer stress. A total of 360 one-day-old, mixed-sex broiler chickens were divided into 6 treatment groups: control or supplemented with 5 mg of genistein•kg of feed(-1), 20 mg of hesperidin•kg of feed(-1), or a mixture of genistein and hesperidin (1:4) at a dosage of 5 mg•kg(-1), 10 mg•kg(-1), and 20 mg•kg(-1) of feed. Broilers were slaughtered at 42 d and samples were analyzed for hematological profile, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and heat shock protein 70 mRNA levels. Results showed that dietary genistein and hesperidin improved (P < 0.05) the weekly performance of broilers particularly during the finisher period. The circulating heterophils and heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios were found to decrease (P < 0.01) in the treated groups. Moreover, biomarkers of heat stress including the level of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and heat shock protein 70 mRNA of breast muscle was also changed (P < 0.01) positively by the dietary compounds with pronounced effects of combined treatments. These findings suggested that genistein and hesperidin could be a prime strategy to ameliorate summer stress effects in broilers; and a combination of both compounds may lead to mutual synergistic effects. It could be suggested that dietary use of both genistein and hesperidin as a feed supplement may offer a potential nutritional strategy in tropical and subtropical regions to overcome the deleterious effects of persistent summer stress in broiler production.",

Three hundred 1-day-old chicks were randomly assigned to 5 treatment groups. Group 1 served as control. Under normal temperature, birds in group 2 received nano-meth (10 mL/L of drinking water) from d1 until the experiment ended. Group 3 birds were heat-stressed (HS) and did not receive any supplementation. Group 4 received nano-meth in the same dose from d1 old until experiment ended, and the birds were exposed to HS. Group 5 birds were HS and received supplementation of nano-meth during the HS period only. Nano-meth improved (P < 0.0001) final body weight, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and also decreased (P < 0.0001) the effect of HS on growth performance. Reduction (P < 0.0001) in malondialdehyde and changes in antioxidant enzymes GPX and CAT activity indicated the antioxidant effect of nano-meth. Nano-meth supplementation caused an increase in the expression of HSP70 , HSP90 and HSF1, and a downregulation of TLR4 gene expression. Additionally, nano-meth-supplemented groups showed marked improvement in the histological liver structure, intestinal morphology and villus height compared to control or HS groups.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "At present, heat stress (HS) has become a key factor that impairs broiler breeding industry, which causes growth restriction and poor meat quality of broilers. Selenium (Se) is an excellent antioxidant and plays a unique role in meat quality improvement. Recent years, nano-selenium (NanoSe) has received tremendous attention in livestock production, due to its characteristic and good antibacterial performance in vitro. Here, we developed the heat stressed-broiler model to investigate the protective effects of NanoSe on growth performance and meat quality of broilers and compare whether there are differences with that of other Se sources (Sodium selenite, SS; Selenoyeast, SeY; Selenomethionine, SeMet). HS jeopardized the growth performance and caused poor meat quality of breast muscle in broilers, which were accompanied by lowered antioxidant capacity, increased glycolysis, increased anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate, mitochondrial stress and abnormal mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. All Se sources supplementation exhibited protective effects, which increased the Se concentration and promoted the expression of selenoproteins, improved the mitochondrial homeostasis and the antioxidant capacity, and promoted the TCA cycle and the aerobic metabolism of pyruvate, thus improved the breast muscle meat quality of broilers exposed to HS. However, unlike the other three Se sources, the protective effect of NanoSe on meat quality of heat stressed-broilers was not ideal, which exhibited limited impact on the pH value, drip loss and cooking loss of the breast muscle. Compared with the other Se sources, broilers received NanoSe showed the lowest levels of slow MyHC, the highest levels of fast MyHC and glycogen, the highest mRNA levels of glycolysis-related genes (PFKM and PKM), the highest protein expression of HSP60 and CLPP, and the lowest enzyme activities of GSH-Px, citroyl synthetase (CS) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) in breast muscle. Consistent with the SS, the Se deposition in breast muscle of broilers received NanoSe was lower than that of broilers received SeY or SeMet. Besides, the regulatory efficiency of NanoSe on the expression of key selenoproteins (such as SELENOS) in breast muscle of heat stressed-broilers was also worse than that of other Se sources. Through comparing the meat quality, Se deposition, muscle fiber type conversion, glycolysis, mitochondrial homeostasis, and mitochondrial TCA cycle-related indicators of breast muscle in heat stressed broilers, we found that the protective effects of organic Se (SeY and SeMet) are better than that of inorganic Se (SS) and NanoSe. As a new Se source, though NanoSe showed some protective effect on breast muscle meat quality of heat stressed broilers, the protective effect of NanoSe is not ideal, compared with other Se sources.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Heat stress can greatly challenge growth and meat quality of broiler chickens where research is looking for sustainable ingredients, such as microalgae, that could also alleviate its negative impacts. Thus, in the present study, 576 1-D-old chicks (Ross 308) were housed until commercial slaughtering (42 D) in 36 pens in 2 rooms of a poultry house, according to a full factorial design encompassing 2 room temperatures (standard vs. high), 2 sexes (females vs. males), and 3 dietary treatments, that is, diet C0 (control diet), diet C3, and diet C6 containing 0, 3, and 6%, respectively, of C. vulgaris meal replacing the same quantities of soybean meal. The highest inclusion level of C. vulgaris decreased feed intake (P < 0.001) and body weight (P < 0.0001) compared to the control diet; it increased yellow and red indexes (P < 0.0001) of the breast muscle, besides the proportion of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (P = 0.028). Heat stress decreased feed intake (P = 0.001), breast (P = 0.001) and p. major yields (P = 0.036), and increased meat pH (P= 0.008) and cooking losses (P < 0.001), umami (P = 0.021) and brothy flavor (P < 0.001), and the proportion of n3 PUFA rates (P = 0.027), while reducing the contents of several amino acids in the breast meat (P ≤ 0.05). Compared to females, males displayed higher feed intake and growth, and more favorable feed conversion (P < 0.001). Carcass and p. major yields were greater in females (P < 0.001) which also showed a higher occurrence of spaghetti meat compared to males (P < 0.001). In conclusion, C. vulgaris can be used to replace until 3% of soybean meal in diets for broiler chickens without negative implications, while positively affecting breast meat color according to consumers' preferences. However, the microalgae inclusion did not mitigate the negative effects of a chronic heat stress on growth performance nor reduced the occurrence of any myopathies.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) is a critical concern to the poultry industry as it affects both productivity and well-being. Various managerial and nutritional strategies have been proposed to mitigate the negative effects of HS in chickens, with plant-based additives showing promise. Recently, we reported the positive effect of a phytogenic feed additive (PFA) on growth performance in HS birds. Owing to the antioxidant nature of these compounds, we sought to further explore the effect of PFA on whole blood circulating chemokines, cytokines, and inflammasomes in HS broilers. Broilers (600 males, 1 d) were randomly assigned to 12 environmental chambers, subjected to 2 environmental conditions (12 h cyclic heat stress, HS, 35°C vs. thermoneutral condition [TN], 24°C) and fed 3 diets (control, PFA-C 250 ppm, PFA-C 400 ppm) in a 2 × 3 factorial design. After 21 d of cyclic HS, blood samples were collected for target gene expression analysis. HS upregulated the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and downregulated glutathione peroxidase-3 (GPX-3), and there was diet × temperature interaction for SOD2, GPX-1, and GPX-3, where gene expression was increased by PFA-C250 during HS but was unchanged for PFA-C400. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were increased by HS. Gene expression of interleukin-18 (IL-18) was decreased by HS, without further effect of PFA. HS increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), but this effect was mitigated by PFA-C400. C-C motif chemokine ligands 4 and 20 (CCL4 and CCL20) showed a similar pattern to TNFα, with PFA-C400 ameliorating the negative effect of HS. The nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was decreased by HS and further lowered by PFA-C400, but the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and CARD domain containing 3 (NLRC3) and nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) inflammasomes were increased by PFA under TN conditions, with no effects of HS. Heat shock proteins (HSP) and heat shock factors (HSF) were unaffected by PFA or HS. Together these data indicate that gene expression of circulating inflammatory factors are dysregulated during HS, and supplemental dietary PFA may be protective.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of heat stress in poultry houses is inevitable and leads to oxidative stress in the birds. Lycopene, a natural hydrocarbon carotenoid, possesses potent antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the impact of lycopene on growth performance, meat quality, cecal microflora, and liver metabolome in broilers subjected to heat stress. A total of 480 yellow feather broilers were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups: birds fed standard diet (Con), birds fed standard diet and supplemented with lycopene (Lyc), birds fed standard diet and subjected to heat stress (Hs), and birds fed with lycopene and subjected to heat stress (Hs-Lyc). As compared with the normal temperature groups, Hs decreased the average daily gain (ADG) of birds during d 1 to 28, lowered the pH value either in breast meat or thigh meat, increased the L* value of breast meat, and decreased the a* value of thigh meat. In comparison with non-Lyc feeding birds, Lyc supplement elevated the ADG during d 1 to 56, increased the pH of breast meat, decrease the L* and b* values of thigh meat, simultaneously increase the a* value of thigh meat. The L* of breast meat and pH of thigh meat exhibited significant differences under Hs-Lyc treatment. Lyc-treated birds exhibited higher elasticity, gumminess, and resilience in breast meat than those in non-Lyc feeding birds. The cecal metagenome analysis indicated that Hs-Lyc treatment increased the abundance of Phocaeicola salanitronis and Prevotella sp.CAG:1058, Bacteroides sp.An269, and Bacteroides sp.An19 at the species level compared with other treatments. The hepatic untargeted metabolome analysis showed that administration of Lyc upregulated 20 metabolites and downregulated 60 metabolites compared to the Con birds. Futhermore, the Hs-Lyc treatment upregulated 34 metabolites and downregulated 45 metabolites compared to the Hs birds. The correlation between the metagenome and metabolome showed that Lyc supplementation induced significant alterations in the citrate cycle, metabolism of butanoate, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate compared with standard supplement. In contrast, Hs-Lyc treatment induced alterations in the citrate cycle, metabolism of pyruvate, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, arginine, proline, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate compared with the standard supplement of heat-challenged broilers. In summary, dietary Lyc supplementation promoted the growth performance, changed the meat quality, modulated the cecal metagenome and hepatic metabolome in heat-stressed broilers.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Exposure to heat stress (HS) is one of the challenges facing the broiler industry worldwide. Various nutritional strategies have been suggested, such as altering dietary concentrations of some nutrients. Thus, we evaluated feeding different amino acid (AA) densities on live performance, Pectoralis (P.) muscles, and expression of selected AA transporters, water channels, and stress-related transcripts in a fast-growing broiler strain. Ross 308 chicks (n = 576) were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatments (24 reps, 6 chicks per rep), differing in AA density (110, 100, 90, and 80% of a breeder's AA specifications). During 24 to 36 days of age, half of the birds were kept at a thermoneutral (TN) temperature of 20°C, whereas the other half were subjected to HS at 32° C for 8 h daily, making the treatment design a 4 × 2. The results revealed no interaction between housing temperature and AA density on growth performance or P. muscles weights. Feeding 80% AAs depressed BWG, FCR, and P. muscles at 36 d (P < 0.001). There was an interaction (P < 0.001) between AA density and temperature on the expression of all examined genes. Reducing the AA density beyond 100% upregulated the expression of AA transporter (CAT1, B<sup>0</sup>AT, b<sup>0,+</sup>AT, SNAT1, LAT1), HSP70, HSP90, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and AQP3 in the TN birds' jejunum. Whereas in the HS birds, inconsistent expressions were observed in the jejunum, of which CAT1, B<sup>0</sup>AT, and LAT1 were markedly downregulated as AA density was reduced. In P. major of TN birds, reducing AA density resulted in upregulating the expression of all AA transporters, HSP70, GR, and AQP1, while downregulating HSP90 and AQP9. In contrast, AA reduction markedly downregulated CAT1, B<sup>0</sup>AT, and LAT1 in the P. major of HS birds. These findings indicate that the dietary AA level alters the expression of various genes involved in AA uptake, protein folding, and water transport. The magnitude of alteration is also dependent on the housing temperature. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of adequate AA nutrition for fast-growing chickens under HS.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Climatic changes and heat stress have become a great challenge in the livestock industry, negatively affecting, in particular, poultry feed intake and intestinal barrier malfunction. Recently, phytogenic feed additives were applied to reduce heat stress effects on animal farming. Here, we investigated the effects of ginseng extract using various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Quantitative real-time PCR, transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and survival assays under heat stress conditions were carried out in various model systems, including Caco-2 cells, <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i> and <i>jejunum</i> samples of broilers. Under heat stress conditions, ginseng treatment lowered the expression of <i>HSPA1A</i> (Caco-2) and the heat shock protein genes <i>hsp-1</i> and <i>hsp-16.2</i> (both in <i>C. elegans</i>), while all three of the tested genes encoding tight junction proteins, <i>CLDN3</i>, <i>OCLN</i> and <i>CLDN1</i> (Caco-2), were upregulated. In addition, we observed prolonged survival under heat stress in <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegan</i><i>s</i>, and a better performance of growing ginseng-fed broilers by the increased gene expression of selected heat shock and tight junction proteins. The presence of ginseng extract resulted in a reduced decrease in transepithelial resistance under heat shock conditions. Finally, LC-MS analysis was performed to quantitate the most prominent ginsenosides in the extract used for this study, being Re, Rg1, Rc, Rb2 and Rd. In conclusion, ginseng extract was found to be a suitable feed additive in animal nutrition to reduce the negative physiological effects caused by heat stress.",

A total of 180 male broilers were randomly allocated to three treatments with four replicates each from 22 to 42 days of age. The broilers were either raised under thermoneutral (TN) conditions (23 ± 1°C) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (28-35-28°C for 12 hr daily). The broilers kept at TN conditions were fed a basal diet, and those exposed to heat stress were fed basal diets supplemented with or without probiotic at a dose of 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup>  cfu/kg. Compared with the TN group, heat stress decreased (p < .05) the growth performance, reduced (p < .05) villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio in intestinal mucosa, increased (p < .05) serum levels of D-lactic acid on day 28 and endotoxin, TNF-α and IL-6 on day 42, and decreased (p < .05) serum IL-10 content on day 42.

    "abstract": "The range of thermoneutral zone of chickens is narrow, and they become easily susceptible to environmental stress, a common and major concern for poultry causing a production loss. The present study was designed to comparatively evaluate anti-stress activity of Phytocee™ and Vitamin C in chickens reared under heat stress. A total of 600-day-old chicks of Cobb 400 were randomly assigned to 4 groups with 6 replicates comprising 25 birds each (<i>n</i> = 150). G1 served as a normal control (NC) and supplemented with Vitamin C at 100 g/ton of feed. G2 served as a heat stress control (HSC), subjected to heat stress (34°C-36°C) without Vitamin C supplementation. G3 and G4 served as positive control and treatment group (TC), subjected to heat stress and supplemented with Vitamin C and Phytocee™ at 100 g/ton of feed, respectively. The impact on zootechnical parameters and cloacal temperature was assessed at regular intervals, and blood was collected at the end of the experiment for evaluation of stress parameters, namely heterophil lymphocyte ratio (H:L ratio) and serum corticosterone. Exposure of chickens to heat stress caused a significant decrease in body weight, worsening of feed conversion ratio, higher mortality, and poor production efficiency. Moreover, serum corticosterone level, H:L ratio, and cloacal temperature were significantly increased in HSC as compared to NC. However, supplementation of Phytocee™ in feed significantly ameliorated the negative impact of heat stress in broiler birds. The supplementation of Phytocee™ demonstrated an anti-stress effect in chickens through restoration of serum corticosterone level, H:L ratio, and thermoregulatory mechanism. Combating heat stress remains a challenge for the broiler industry in the tropics and subtropics, which is even aggravated by the changing climatic conditionsThe present study was designed to evaluate the anti-stressor activity of Phytocee™, a polyherbal formulation containing <i>Emblica officinalis</i>, <i>Ocimum sanctum</i>, and <i>Withania somnifera</i> in broiler using heat stress model in comparison with Vitamin CPhytocee™ demonstrated an anti-stress effect in the current study by ameliorating the negative effects of heat stress on zootechnical parameters, serum corticosterone, heterophil lymphocyte ratio, and cloacal temperature of broilers through modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thermoregulatory mechanismHence, Phytocee™ could be recommended in broilers and livestock animals for modulating and combating adverse effects of heat stress and thereby reducing the economic losses incurred by farmers. <b>Abbreviations Used:</b> HPA axis: Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "The study aims to investigate the immunological role of chlorogenic acid (CA) on the intestinal health of broiler under chronic heat stress. 240 broilers were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group with a feeding temperature of (22 ± 2) °C, and the other three groups with a feeding temperature of (30 ± 2) °C. The chronic heat stress group (HS group) was fed with the basic diet daily, while the high-dose CA groups (HCA group) and low-dose (LCA group) were supplemented with CA at 600 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, respectively. The health performance, intestinal antioxidant indicators, inflammatory factors, heat shock proteins, and barrier integrity-related protein expression were tested. The results showed that 600 mg/kg CA in the basic diet was promoted the morphological and cellular performance of intestinal epithelial cells of heat-stressed broilers and significantly increased the ADG (P < 0.05). HCA significantly improved the activity of SOD and CAT in the intestinal tract of heat-stressed broilers (P < 0.05), and significantly reduced the content of peroxides MDA (P < 0.05). HCA significantly inhibited the concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (P < 0.05), significantly increased the content of IL-10 (P < 0.05). Further, HCA significantly downregulated the proteins and genes expression of HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 (P < 0.05), and significantly upregulated the proteins and genes expression of Claudin1, Occludin, and ZO-1 (P < 0.05), thereby promoting intestinal barrier integrity. These findings highlight the potential of CA as a functional additive to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress in poultry production.",

    "abstract": "This experiment was undertaken to evaluate the effect of dietary vitamin A on the performance and immune competence of broilers under heat stress (HS). A total of 180 birds, at 22 days of age, were randomly assigned to be reared either at 24°C (thermoneutral, TN, 24°C, constant) or 24°C to 38°C (heat stress, HS, cycling) until the age of 42 days. Birds were then supplemented with vitamin A at 750, 1500, 15 000 IU/kg. Each of the 2 × 3 factorially arranged treatments were replicated in six cages, each containing five birds. Humoral immunity was assessed by intravenous injection of 7% sheep red blood cells (SRBC) followed by evaluation of serum for antibody titers in primary and secondary responses. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed by using a Sephadax stimulation method to recruit abdominal exudate cells (AEC) to evaluate macrophage phagocytic ability. Body weight (BW) and feed conversion were significantly affected by dietary vitamin A (P < 0.05). HS significantly reduced BW, feed intake and feed conversion (P < 0.05). Numbers of AEC, percentage of macrophages in AEC, phagocytic macrophages, internalized opsonized and unopsonized SRBC were increased by dietary vitamin A (P < 0.05). Both primary and secondary antibody responses were characterized by increasing titers of antibody to SRBC by dietary vitamin A when birds were exposed to HS (P < 0.05). Lymphoid organ weights, antibody responses, incidence of macrophages in AEC and phagocytic ability of macrophages were all significantly reduced under HS. These results indicated that HS severely reduced performance and immunocompetence of broilers, whereas the immune response of broilers improved by dietary vitamin A supplementation under HS.",

    "abstract": "High ambient temperature in poultry is a challenging and fatal stress among environmental factors. It affects the production quality, damages the liver, and increases mortality in broilers. The present study is focused to explore appropriate utilization of Selenium (Se) as a feed additive in broiler chickens against high temperature. Day-old male broiler chickens (Ross 308) (<i>n</i> = 200) were grouped according to the supplements used in their basal diets such as: corn-soybean basal diet as control (Con), a basal diet containing sodium selenite, basal diet with probiotics, and a basal diet containing selenium-enriched probiotics (SP). At the end of the experimental period of 42 days, the liver was isolated and was used to determine the antioxidant capacity through a spectrophotometer. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines production in the liver was measured through a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hepatic analyses revealed the decreased level of malondialdehyde, whereas glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase levels were increased in the SP group. Furthermore, supplementation of SP significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), GPx4, IL6, and IL10 and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is thus concluded that SP as a potential nutritive supplement may facilitate hepatic protection by suppressing hepatic oxidation, inflammation, and necrosis during the high ambient temperature of summer.",

    "abstract": "Probiotics have growth promoting effects even under periods of heat stress challenge. More information is needed to understand the mechanisms by which probiotics maintain the growth performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic based on Bacillus subtilis bacteria on growth related mechanisms of broilers under heat stress conditions. Specifically, growth performance, skeletal bone characteristics, skeletal muscles size, intestinal villus-crypt structure, intestinal bacteria, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cholesterol, and glucose. A total of 1200 one day old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly distributed into 4 treatments, with 12 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. A 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was used; the main factors were environmental temperature (thermoneutral or heat stress) and diet (control or control + B. subtilis; 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/kg of feed). From d 22 to 35 of age, birds were either exposed to thermoneutral conditions (21 °C) or chronic heat stress (30 °C). During the same period, each group was divided into 2 subgroups and fed either the control diet or the B. subtilis supplemented diet. The results demonstrated that B. subtilis had positive effects (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, absorptive epithelial cell area and viable counts of intestinal beneficial bacteria. B. subtilis increased (P < 0.05) serum GH, IGF-1 and maintain normal levels of cholesterol and glucose under heat stress conditions. In addition, broilers fed B. subtilis under heat stress conditions exhibited higher (P < 0.05) skeletal muscles size and improved (P < 0.05) tibia traits and lower (P < 0.05) abdominal fat pads deposition compared with the controls. B. subtilis had no effect on rectal temperature under thermoneutral or heat stress conditions. It is concluded that B. subtilis can be used as growth promoters in broilers, particularly during the periods of heat stress conditions.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, phytogenic products have received great attention as a growth promoter due to their safety and environmentally friendly effect as a replacement for classical growth promoters such as antibiotics in animal nutrition. Thus, this research seeks the possibility of using fennel seed powder (FSP) as a dietary additive from 19 to 41 days of age on productive performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and production efficiency of broiler chickens raised under thermoneutral and chronic heat stress conditions. Thus, 216 one-day-old Ross-308 broiler chicks were divided into two equal groups. The first group was placed in an independent temperature-controlled room at 23 ± 2 °C. The broiler chicks from the second group were placed in a heat-stressed room and exposed to chronic heat stress conditions (32 ± 2 °C) for seven hours per day from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. The experimental design was 2 × 3 factorial including two environmental temperatures (thermoneutral vs chronic heat stress) and three experimental diets that contained 0, 1.6, and 3.2% FSP. The chickens were randomly assigned to 18-floor pens per room temperature, representing six replicates per treatment and six birds per replicate. The results showed that dietary fennel seed powder during days 19-41 of age enhanced the growth rate of broiler chickens and improved breast meat redness and reduced temperature under chronic heat stress. In conclusion, 3.2% of fennel seed powder could be used as an agent for enhancing the broiler's tolerance during chronic heat stress condition from 19 to 41 days of age. Moreover, it is necessary to study in further detail the nitrite and nitrate contents in FSP and their impacts on muscle redness (a*) as well as muscle temperature.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that their utilization in the pre-hatch period would affect embryonic development, IGF-I and TLR4 gene expression, antioxidant status, serum biochemical profile, and jejunum histomorphometry of newly hatched Ross broiler chicks incubated under heat stress conditions. A total of 150 fertile broiler eggs were subjected to heat stress (39.6 °C for 6 h/d) from d10 until d18 and injected at d 17.5 of incubation with methionine and cysteine (Met-Cys) at a dose of 5.90 mg l-methionine plus 3.40 mg l-cysteine. The effects of Met-Cys administration were examined and compared with the control (Non-injected group) and 0.75% NaCl injected group. The results showed that no significant differences among all groups in serum protein profiles (total protein, albumin, globulin, and albumin/globulin ratio) and creatine kinase were observed. The level of heat shock protein-90 was decreased with Met-Cys <i>In ovo</i> injection. The <i>In ovo</i> injection of Met-Cys also improved the values of total antioxidants capacity and glutathione in examined tissues. At the same time, an increase in fold change mRNA abundance of IGF-I and TLR4 was observed after Met-Cys injection in tested tissues. Finally, an increase of 29% in villus area was found after Met-Cys injection compared to the control group.

To achieve this, a total of 1,400 fertile hatching eggs were randomly distributed into 5 groups (n = 280/group) and injected with one of the following in ovo treatments on embryonic day 18: 52 µL of sterile diluent/egg (CTRL), CTRL + 1.0 mg of L-Leucine (T1), CTRL + 0.45 mg of leucine + 1.15 mg of methionine (T2), CTRL + 3.0 mg of methionine + 2.0 mg of cysteine (T3), and CTRL + 0.40 mg of leucine + 1.60 mg of methionine + 1.60 mg of cysteine (T4). After hatch, chicks were allocated according to a complete randomized block design comprising 2 thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24°C, 45% RH) and heat stress (34°C, 55-60% RH) with 5 pens/group/condition. The cyclical heat stress regimen (10 h/d) was then applied from d 29 to d 34. Compared to the CTRL group, T3 and T4 exhibited a higher BW during the starter phase (P < 0.001). T4 also had a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) than CTRL during this same phase (P = 0.03). During the grower phase, males of all treatment groups consistently exhibited higher BW compared to the CTRL group, which was not observed among female birds (P<sub>Sex × TRT</sub> = 0.005). During the finisher phase, the in ovo treatment effect on performance was not significant. However, heat-stressed birds from treatment group T3 and T4 exhibited lower facial temperatures (P<sub>day × TRT</sub> < 0.001) as well as lower plasma (P<sub>condition x TRT</sub> = 0.039) and liver (P<sub>condition x TRT</sub> < 0.001) malonaldehyde concentrations compared to the CTRL group.

Dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet without essential oil (EO, negative control) and three diets containing low (100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), intermediate (200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), or high (300 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) levels of turmeric EO. In the heat stress group, dietary supplementation with turmeric EO at 100 and 200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> improved body weight, feed conversion, breast yield, and relative liver weight. These supplementation levels reduced villus width, increased villus/crypt ratio, reduced the H/L ratio, and improved hepatic (HSP70 and SREBP1) and intestinal (OCLN) gene expression in birds under heat stress. These findings support the hypothesis that turmeric EO can be used to improve or restore intestinal integrity, modulate inflammation parameters, and, consequently, enhance the performance of broilers challenged by cyclic heat stress.",

In order to examine the effect of Ban Lian Zi Jin San (BLZJS) on intestinal inflammation and barrier function in heat-stressed broilers, a model of chronic cyclic HS in broilers was established. A total of 300 twenty-one-day-old broilers were divided into 5 treatments at random. Broilers in 3 BLZJS dosage groups were kept in an ecologically controlled room at 37℃ ± 2℃ for 6 wk, and fed basal diets supplemented with 0.5, 1, and 2% BLZJS. Broilers in HS group were housed in the same room, but fed the basal diets. The findings indicated that supplementation of BLZJS significantly declined serum HS indexes levels (HSP70, HSP90), and increased serum antioxidant capacity (SOD and T-AOC) in broilers (P < 0.05). Besides, supplementation of BLZJS significantly inhibited the expression of HS indexes (HSP70 and HSP90), genes related to TLR4 inflammatory signal pathway (TLR4, MyD88, TRIF, IRAK-4, and NF-κB), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α), and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and intestinal tight junction-related genes (Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1) in broiler jejunum (P < 0.05). On the other hand, supplementation of BLZJS could significantly reduce the protein expression of NF-κB and HSP70 in chick jejunum (P < 0.05). In conclusion, BLZJS inhibited the activation of TLR4 signal pathway and reduced the production of inflammatory factors, restoring the level of intestinal tight junction protein and protecting jejunal intestinal barrier function in heat-stressed broilers.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress markedly impairs the growth performance of broilers, such as the reduction of breast muscle mass and yield. The aim of this study was to examine the molecular mechanism of depressed muscle mass and yield caused by heat stress. A total of 144 (28-day-old) male broilers were allocated randomly into 3 treatment groups: (1) the normal control group (environment temperature was 22°C), (2) the heat stress group (environment temperature was 32°C), (3) the pair-fed group (environment temperature was 22°C and pair-fed to heat stress group). The experiment lasted for 14 d (from the age of 28 to 42 d). After 14 d of heat exposure, heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) broiler average daily gain, breast muscle mass, and muscle yield, and increased (P < 0.05) feed to gain ratio. After 14 d of heat exposure, heat stress increased (P < 0.05) the activities of aspartate aminotransferase and the concentrations of uric acid and most amino acids in serum, and reduced (P < 0.05) the concentration of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in serum. Additionally, heat stress decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expressions of IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the 70 kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase, myogenic differentiation, myogenin, solute carrier family 38 member 2, solute carrier family 7 member 5, and solute carrier family 3 member 2 of the breast muscle. In conclusion, chronic heat stress resulted in lower breast muscle mass and yield, and decreased muscle protein synthesis and amino acid transportation by downregulating IGFs-mTOR signal pathway. These findings have important practical significance in discovering effective means to alleviate muscle loss caused by chronic heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) is one of the most significant environmental stressors on poultry production and welfare worldwide. Identification of innovative and effective solutions is necessary. This study evaluated the effects of phytogenic feed additives (PHY) containing Terminalia bellirica and Andrographis paniculata on behavioral patterns, hematological and biochemical parameters, Oxidative stress biomarkers, and HSP70, I-FABP2, IL10, TLR4, and mTOR genes expression in different organs of broiler chickens under chronic HS conditions. A total of 208 one-day-old Avian-480 broiler chicks were randomly allocated into four treatments (4 replicate/treatment, 52 birds/treatment): Thermoneutral control treatment (TN, fed basal diet); Thermoneutral treatment (TN, fed basal diet + 1 kg/ton feed PHY); Heat stress treatment (HS, fed basal diet); Heat stress treatment (HS, fed basal diet + 1 kg/ton feed PHY). The findings of the study indicate that HS led to a decrease in feeding, foraging, walking, and comfort behavior while increasing drinking and resting behavior, also HS increased red, and white blood cells (RBCs and WBCs) counts, and the heterophile/ lymphocyte (H/L) ratio (P < 0.05); while both mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were decreased (P < 0.05). In addition, HS negatively impacted lipid, protein, and glucose levels, liver and kidney function tests, and oxidative biomarkers by increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and decreasing reduced glutathion (GSH) activity (P < 0.05). Heat stress (HS) caused the upregulation in HSP70, duodenal TLR4 gene expression, and the downregulation of I-FABP2, IL10, mTOR in all investigated tissues, and hepatic TLR4 (P < 0.05) compared with the TN treatment. Phytogenic feed additives (PHY) effectively mitigated heat stress's negative impacts on broilers via an improvement of broilers' behavior, hematological, biochemical, and oxidative stress biomarkers with a marked decrease in HSP70 expression levels while all tissues showed increased I-FABP2, IL10, TLR4, and mTOR (except liver) levels (P < 0.05). Phytogenic feed additives (PHY) containing Terminalia bellirica and Andrographis paniculata have ameliorated the HS-induced oxidative stress and improved the immunity as well as the gut health and welfare of broiler chickens.",

    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "Heat stress has a profound effect on poultry health and productivity. The present study evaluated whether feeding betaine could ameliorate long-term heat stress-induced impairment of productive performance in indigenous yellow-feathered broilers. A total of 240 five-week-old male broilers were randomly allocated to five treatments with six replicates of eight broilers each. The five treatments included a thermoneutral zone control group (TN, fed basal diet), a heat stress control group (HS, fed basal diet), and an HS control group supplemented 500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg betaine, respectively. The TN group was raised at 26 ± 1 °C during the whole study, HS groups exposed to 32 ± 1 °C for 8 h/day from 9:00 am to 17:00 pm. The results showed that heat stress decreased the body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake of broilers during 1-5, 6-10, and 1-10 weeks (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Dietary betaine tended to improve the BWG and feed intake of broilers under 5 weeks of heat stress (linear, <i>p</i> < 0.10), and betaine supplementation linearly increased the BWG and feed intake during 6-10 and 1-10 weeks (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, nitrogen retention was reduced by 5 weeks and 10 weeks of heat stress (p < 0.05), whereas dietary betaine could improve nitrogen retention in heat stressed broilers after both 5 and 10 weeks of heat stress (linear, p < 0.05). Moreover, this study observed that the trypsin activity of jejunum was decreased by 5 weeks of heat stress (p < 0.05), whereas betaine supplementation had quadratic effects on trypsin activity of jejunum in heat stressed broilers (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 10 weeks of heat stress induced a reduction of villus height of the duodenum and jejunum (p < 0.05), and decreased the villus height to crypt depth ratio of the jejunum (p < 0.05). Supplementation with betaine ameliorated the adverse effects of heat stress on these parameters (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Compared with the TN group, 10 weeks of heat stress reduced carcass and breast yield (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and betaine supplementation improved carcass and breast yield of heat stressed broilers (linear, <i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of betaine could reduce the detrimental effects of long-term heat stress on growth performance, digestive function, and carcass traits in indigenous yellow-feathered broilers.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate that effect of duration of thermal stress on growth performance, oxidative stress indices in serum, the expression and localization of ABCG2, and mitochondria ROS production in skeletal muscle, small intestine and immune organs, and then to further reveal correlations between indicators. At 28 days of age, sixty broilers were randomly divided into the control group (25 ± 2 °C; 24 h/day) and the heat stress group (36 ± 2 °C; 8 h/day lasted for 1 week or 2 weeks). Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress. A typical heat stress response has been observed at this temperature. Compared with the control group, the birds subjected to heat stress at the end of the 1st week reduced (P ＜ 0.05) body weight (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), the activity of serum antioxidant enzyme and content of glutathione (GSH), while increased (P ＜ 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P ＞ 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change. Moreover, heat stress also did not affect (P ＞ 0.05) the IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in the pectorales, crureus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and spleen, while significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05) the corresponding tissues ROS production at the end of the 1st week of heat stress. In contrast, at the end of the 2nd week of heat stress, IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in heat stress group significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05), while the corresponding tissues ROS production had no difference (P ＞ 0.05) compared to the control group. Collectively, duration of thermal stress affects growth performance, serum oxidative stress indices, and the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production of broiler tissues in a time-dependent manner. There is a negative correlation between the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production in the corresponding tissues under heat stress.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "To assess the impact of supplementing betaine (BT) under heat stress (HS) conditions on broiler performance and intestinal health from 21 to 42 days of age, a total of 150 male Ross 308 broilers were indiscriminately allotted to 3 treatments with 10 replications of 5 birds each. The control (CON) group was given a basal ration and accommodated at a thermoneutral condition (22 ± 1 °C), whereas the HS and HS + BT groups were raised under cyclic HS (33 ± 1 °C for 8 h and 22 ± 1 °C for 16 h per day) and received the basal ration without or with 1000 mg/kg BT, respectively. The HS reduced average daily gain (ADG); average daily feed intake; villus height (VH); VH to crypt depth (CD) ratio (VCR); activities of trypsin, lipase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase; and enumeration of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05) and augmented feed conversion ratio (FCR), CD, malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation, and enumeration of Escherichia coli, Clostridium, and coliforms (P < 0.05). Conversely, BT supplementation heightened ADG, VH, VCR, trypsin activity, GPX activity, and populations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05) and lowered FCR, MDA accumulation, and Clostridium population (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the FCR value, trypsin and GPX activities, MDA content, and Bifidobacterium and Clostridium populations in the HS + BT group were nearly equivalent to those in the CON group. To conclude, feeding BT under HS conditions could improve broiler performance through improving intestinal health by specifically mitigating oxidative damage and enhancing the colonization of beneficial bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Summer high temperatures (27-38 °C, more than 7 days) readily induce heat stress in late-laying broiler breeders, which impedes offspring growth and development. This study aimed to provide a scientific basis for improving the offspring development of late-laying broiler breeders during summer. Six hundred fertilized eggs from 50-week-old LiFeng broiler breeders were divided into five treatment groups (non-injected, NaCl-injected, 6 mg/egg L-arginine-injected, 3.5 mg/egg L-methionine-injected, 8.4 mg/egg L-leucine-injected), with six replicates per group and 20 eggs per replicate. Embryos were incubated for 21 days and chicks raised for 21 days post-hatch. Methionine injection significantly enhanced hatchability (+5.8%), increased daily chick weight gain (+8.8%), reduced serum urea nitrogen (-53.13%), decreased inflammatory cytokine levels, elevated antioxidant enzyme activities, lowered malondialdehyde content (-47.99%), and suppressed expression of inflammatory and apoptotic pathway genes. The comprehensive effect of methionine was the best among the three amino acids when injected into chicken embryos. Methionine promoted protein synthesis, enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities, and consequently improved chick growth performance.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress is the most common environmental stressor in poultry production, negatively affecting growth performance, meat quality, and welfare. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the nutritional effects of dietary supplementation with selenomethionine, Bacillus subtilis (BS), and a combination of selenomethionine and BS on broilers challenged with heat stress. A total of 300 21-day-old male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to 5 groups with 6 replicates of 10 broilers per each: control group (CON, broilers raised at 22 ± 2 °C), heat stress exposure group (HS, broilers raised at 32 ± 2 °C for 8 h/d), HSS group (HS group supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg selenomethionine), HSB group (HS group supplemented with 1 × 109 cfu/kg BS), and HSBS group (HS group supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg selenomethionine and × 109 cfu/kg BS). The experiment lasted for 21 d. The results indicated that, compared to the CON group, heat stress reduces (P < 0.05) broiler growth performance and damages the meat quality in breast and thigh muscles. Dietary supplementation with selenomethionine and BS did not improve the growth performance of broilers under heat stress. However, compared to the HS group, the HSS, HSB, and HSBS groups showed significantly increased (P < 0.05) pH45 min, redness (a*) and yellowness (b*), muscle fiber density, intramuscular fat, triglyceride content, and expression levels of Myf5, CAPN 2, FM, SLC27A1, A-FABP, H-FABP, APOB-100, and ACC in breast and thigh muscles. Meanwhile, these groups showed reduced (P < 0.05) lightness (L*), drip loss, shear force, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and FM gene expression level. The HSBS group showed greater improvement in the physicochemical quality of muscle and volatile substances compared to the HSS and HSB groups. In conclusion, selenomethionine and BS improved meat quality and flavor in broilers under heat stress by modulating muscle fiber composition and characteristics, as well as increasing intramuscular fat deposition.",

The alterations of serum total protein, albumin, total cholesterol levels and aspartate aminotransferase activity under HS were reversed (P < 0.05) by GE, which also decreased (P < 0.05) serum triglyceride level and alanine aminotransferase activity. The decreased redness (a* value) and increased drip loss of breast muscle induced by HS were restored (P < 0.05) by GE. Moreover, GE supplementation increased (P < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity and decreased (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde content in liver and breast muscle, and increased (P < 0.05) glutathione peroxidase activity in serum and breast muscle. In conclusion, dietary GE supplementation restored growth performance, serum metabolites and meat quality of broilers under HS possibly by improving antioxidant activity.",

    "abstract": "Selenium is a heat-stress-reducing substance that improves heat resistance and is being studied for its effective application in the broiler industry. However, research on feed additives is labor-intensive and time-consuming because of the need for feeding experiments. We aimed to compare the effects of selenium under heat stress in vitro and in ovo, specifically examining the gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) and inflammatory markers. Two groups were included in the in-vitro study: in-vitro control (TC; selenium 0 μg/ml) and in-vitro selenium (TS; selenium 5 μg/ml). The satellite cells were cultured at 42°C for 48 h after selenium treatment. The in-ovo study comprised 4 groups: in-ovo control and in-ovo selenium 1-3 (OC, OS1, OS2, and OS3; selenium 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/egg, respectively). Selenium was injected on the 18th day after hatching, and heat treatment was performed at 32-34°C from the 14th to the 21st day after hatching, and the leg muscles of the chicks were collected on the 21st day. The gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSP), caspase3, nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), and IL-8 was analyzed in in-vitro and in-ovo experiments, respectively. In-vitro results showed significant increases in HSP90, HSP60, and HSP40 in TS compared to TC, with a significant decrease in HSP70. In the in-ovo study, HSP70, caspase3, NF-kB and IL-8 were significantly increased in OS1. HSP90, HSP60, HSP40, HSP27 and NF-kB were significantly decreased in in-ovo OS2 compared to in-vitro TS, implying a trend in ratio compared to control. Selenium appeared to enhance heat resistance in-vitro and in-ovo by modulating HSPs and inflammation. However, differences in mRNA expression were observed depending on the concentration of selenium. These findings suggest that selenium modulates heat resistance through different mechanisms in-vitro and in-ovo, likely due to the complexity of whole-organism interactions in-ovo compared to the single-cell-type environment in-vitro. Therefore, to directly apply in-vitro results to in-ovo, a concentration comparison study for each additive is necessary.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Genetic selection for high growth rate has resulted in spectacular progress in feed efficiency in chickens. As feed intake and water consumption (WC) are associated and both are affected by environmental conditions, we evaluated WC and its hypothalamic regulation in three broiler-based research lines and their ancestor jungle fowl (JF) under heat stress (HS) conditions. Slow growing ACRB, moderate growing 95RB, fast growing MRB, and JF were exposed to daily chronic cyclic HS (36 °C, 9 h/d) or thermoneutral temperature (24 °C). HS increased WC in the MRB only. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA levels were decreased by HS in the MRB. Within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system, renin expression was increased by HS in the JF, ACRB, and 95RB, while angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II receptors (type 1, AT1, and type 2, AT2) were affected by line. The expression of aquaporin (AQP2, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12) genes was upregulated by HS, whereas AQP4 and AQP5 expressions were influenced by line. miRNA processing components (Dicer1, Ago2, Drosha) were significantly different among the lines, but were unaffected by HS. In summary, this is the first report showing the effect of HS on hypothalamic water channel- and noncoding RNA biogenesis-related genes in modern chicken populations and their ancestor JF. These results provide a novel framework for future research to identify new molecular mechanisms and signatures involved in water homeostasis and adaptation to HS.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress adversely affects poultry production and meat quality, leading to economic losses. This study aimed to investigate the effects of adding tributyrin on growth performance, meat quality, muscle oxidative status, and gut microbiota of Taihe silky fowls under cyclic heat stress (CHS) conditions. In this study, 120-day-old Taihe silky fowls (male) were randomly divided into six dietary treatments. These treatments included a normal control treatment (NC, fed a basal diet), a heat stress control treatment (HS, fed a basal diet), and HS control treatments supplemented with 0.04%, 0.08%, 0.16%, and 0.32% tributyrin, respectively. The NC treatment group was kept at 24 ± 1 °C, while the HS treatment birds were exposed to 34 ± 1 °C for 8 h/d for 4 weeks. Results showed that CHS decreased growth performance and compromised the meat quality of broilers (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, tributyrin supplementation improved ADG and FCR in broilers exposed to CHS (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, tributyrin supplementation resulted in increased shear force value and GSH-Px activity, as well as a decrease in drip loss, ether extract content, and MDA content of the breast muscle in broilers under CHS (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, tributyrin supplementation up-regulated the mRNA expressions of <i>Nrf2</i>, <i>NQO1</i>, <i>HO-1</i>, <i>SOD</i>, and <i>GSH-Px</i> of the breast muscle in broilers exposed to CHS (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Based on these positive effects, the study delved deeper to investigate the impact of 0.16% tributyrin supplementation (HS + 0.16%T) on the cecum microbiota. The HS + 0.16%T treatment showed an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and a trend towards an increase in <i>Lactobacillus</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.096) compared to the HS treatment. The results indicate that supplementation successfully improved the growth performance and meat quality of Taihe silky fowls. Furthermore, tributyrin supplementation, particularly at levels of 0.16%, improved meat quality by enhancing muscle antioxidant capacity, which is believed to be associated with activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Water scarcity is a current, significant global concern that will only increase under the pressure of climate change. Improving water efficiency of poultry is a new and promising area to help temper agriculture's future impact on fresh water availability. Here, we explored the effects of acute heat stress (HS) on circulating stress and inflammatory markers in 2 lines of broilers divergently selected for water efficiency. Male chicks from low (LWE) and high water efficient (HWE) lines were raised in 12 environmental chambers (2 pens/chamber, 6 chambers/line, 20 birds/pen) under normal conditions until day 28. On day 29, birds were subjected to thermoneutral (TN, 25 °C) or HS (36 °C) conditions, resulting in four treatments (2 lines × 2 environmental conditions). After 3 h of HS, whole blood was collected (8 birds per line × environment) and analyzed for target gene expression and plasma cytokine levels. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, with line, environment, and their interaction as main factors, and means were compared using Tukey's multiple range test. Gene expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 27, HSP70, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), CCL20, nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), NLR family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5), and NLR family member X1 (NLRX1) were increased by HS, with no differences between the lines. HSP70, IL-10, and NLRC3 were lower in the HWE as compared to the LWE lines. Additionally, there were interactive effects between line and environment for HSP90, IL-4, and CCL4, where HS induced HSP90 expression in the LWE only, and IL-4 and CCL4 in HWE only. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene expression was significantly lower in the whole blood of the HWE line; however, plasma protein levels were not different. Overall, most of the effects seen on cyto (chemokines) and inflammatory markers were due to acute HS, with only a few genes differentially regulated between the lines. This likely indicates that the divergent selection for water efficiency for four generations did not elicit changes in inflammation and stress molecular signatures.",

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted 1) to investigate the effects of gender and temperature on growth performance in broiler chickens and 2) to establish body protein and fat deposition curves and amino acid patterns for broilers of both genders at different ambient temperatures. A total of 432 1-day-old (d) Arbor Acres chickens with a male/female ratio of 1:1 were randomly divided into the following 4 treatment groups: the male thermoneutral group, the female thermoneutral group, the male heat stress group, and the female heat stress group. The chickens in the thermoneutral groups were kept at a comfortable temperature from 1 to 42 d, while chickens in the heat stress groups were kept at a comfortable temperature from 1 to 28 d and at a high ambient temperature from d 29 to 42. The body composition retention data were obtained by comparative slaughter method, and the models were constructed by the Gompertz model. The results revealed significant variation in body protein content (BPC) and body fat deposition efficiency (BFE) between both genders and the 2 temperatures. Moreover, a noteworthy interaction between gender and temperature was observed in terms of the BPC and protein deposition efficiency (BPE). The following equations for body protein and body fat deposition in the thermoneutral groups were obtained: Body protein weight of male broilers: [Formula: see text] ; Body protein weight of female broilers: [Formula: see text] ; Body fat weight of male broilers: [Formula: see text] ; Body fat weight of female broilers: [Formula: see text] . Where t means age (d).

Where t means age (d). In addition, no significant difference in amino acid content was found between different genders and temperatures. The amino acid pattern could be divided into 2 stages: 0 to 14 d and 15 to 42 d. Our equations and patterns enable a deeper understanding of the nutritional requirements in broiler chickens under various temperature conditions. This enables researchers to develop more accurate feeding programs to fulfill the growth and health requirements of broiler chickens.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "High temperatures have detrimental effects on the performance and physiology of broiler chickens. Medicinal plants have various biological activities and may enhance the heat resistance of chickens during heat waves. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential roles of using specific local medicinal plants to alleviate the negative impacts of heat stress (HS) in broilers. In this study, 180 day-old chicks were used to investigate the effects of HS and dietary indigenous medicinal plants on growth performance, antioxidant biomarkers, and intestinal health. The chicks were assigned to six groups (18 pens with 10 chicks per pen) with three replicates each. In the first group, the chicks were kept under thermoneutral conditions (CON) and fed a basal diet. The other five groups were exposed to recurrent heat stress and fed a basal diet (T1, HS group) or supplemented with Artemisia Sieberi (1.25 g/kg of feed; T2), Achillea Fragrantissima (15 g/kg of feed; T3), <i>Olea europaea</i> (10 g/kg of feed; T4), and all the previous additives (all-in-one) combined at the same dose levels mentioned above (T5). At 21 days of age, the chicks from each group were exposed to two phases of heat stress: phase 1 from days 21 to 34 (34 ± 1°C) followed by phase 2 from days 35 to 39 (37 ± 1°C). The results indicate that HS significantly increased rectal temperature and respiration rate in broiler chickens. Feed intake and body weight gain were improved in all supplemented groups, while the feed conversion ratio was decreased in response to the dietary inclusion of medicinal plants. Additionally, glutathione peroxidase and immunoglobulin G levels were increased in the T3, T4, and T5 groups compared to the other groups. HS induced significant upregulated in the mRNA levels of heat shock protein 70 and interleukin-8, while the mRNA of occludin was decreased. The T3, T4, and T5 showed significantly decreased expression of hepatic HSP70 and ileum IL-8 genes and increased ileum mRNA occludin levels relative to the CON and T1 groups. In conclusion, supplementation with these plants enhances growth performance and maintains intestinal health sustaining the productivity of broiler chickens under HS conditions.",

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract is considered as one of the main target organs affected by heat stress. Phytogenic feed additives containing phenolics and flavonoids can improve the resistance of broilers to heat stress. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with enzymatically treated Artemisia annua (EA) on growth performance, intestinal morphology, digestive enzyme activities, immunity and antioxidant capacity of broilers challenged with heat stress. One hundred and forty-four 21-day-old male Arbor Acres broilers were randomly distributed into 3 treatments: 1) non-challenged control (CON); 2) heat-stress-challenged control (HS); and 3) heat-stress-challenged group + 1 g EA/kg diet (HS-EA). From 22 to 41 d, broilers in the CON group were housed at 22 ± 1°C, the HS and HS-EA groups, in which broilers were raised at 34 ± 1°C for 8 h (0900-1700 h) and the temperature for the rest time was the same as that of the CON group. The EA supplementation alleviated the compromised body weight gain and intestinal morphology impairment caused by heat stress challenge (P < 0.05). The EA attenuated heat-stress-induced decreased intestinal lipase, trypsin and total superoxide dismutase activities, and reduced intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and IgG concentrations (P < 0.05). The EA inclusion prevented the elevation of intestinal malondialdehyde content and reduction of intestinal glutathione concentration induced by heat stress challenge (P < 0.05). The intestinal mRNA abundances of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, heme oxygenase 1, glutathione peroxidase, gamma-glutamyl cysteine ligase larger catalytic subunit and gamma-glutamyl cysteine ligase smaller modulator subunit in heat-stressed broilers were increased in response to dietary EA treatment (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 1 g/kg EA could alleviate heat-stress-induced compromised growth performance and intestinal damage of broilers.",

The up-regulation of cloacal temperature confirmed that our experiment was successful in inducing chronic heat stress. The average daily gain and average daily feed intake of the HS group were significantly lower than those of the NC group, by 28·76 and 18·42 %, respectively (P1 and P<0·05). The greater feed:gain ratio of the HS group was significantly positively correlated with the leg, abdominal fat, subcutaneous fat and intramuscular fat proportions and levels of some free amino acids (proline, l-cysteine, methionine and threonine) but was negatively correlated with breast proportion and levels of some NEFA (stearic acid, arachidonic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid). These findings indicated that the heat-stressed broilers were in negative energy balance and unable to effectively mobilise fat, thereby resulting in protein decomposition, which subsequently affected growth performance and carcass characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) causes oxidative stress, which compromises broiler performance and meat quality. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary antioxidants could be used as an amelioration strategy. Seventy-two day-old-male Ross-308 chicks were exposed to either thermoneutral or cyclical heat stress conditions. Diets were either control commercial diet (CON), CON plus betaine (BET), or with a combination of betaine, selenized yeast, and vitamin E (BET + AOX). Heat stress increased the rectal temperature (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respiration rate (<i>p</i> < 0.001), decreased blood pCO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and increased blood pH (<i>p</i> = 0.02), which indicated the HS broilers had respiratory alkalosis. Final body weight was decreased by HS (<i>p</i> < 0.001), whereas it was improved with BET (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Heat stress reduced cooking loss (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and no effect on drip loss, while BET decreased the drip loss (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Heat stress reduced the myofibril fragmentation index (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while these were improved with the combination of BET + AOX (<i>p</i> = 0.003). In conclusion, BET overall improved growth rates and product quality in this small university study, whereas some additional benefits were provided by AOX on product quality in both TN and HS broilers.",

    "abstract": "This research was conducted to evaluate the impact of dietary or drinking water <i>Ruminococcus</i> sp. supplementation and/or heat stress (HS) on the growth, serum biochemistry, tissue antioxidant, phagocytic assay, histopathology, and bursa gene expression of broilers. Day-old broiler chicks were allotted into six groups according to HS and/or <i>Ruminococcus</i> with or without enzyme supplementation. The first group was the control one, with a formulated diet and normal environmental temperature but without any supplement. The second group fed on <i>Ruminococcus</i>-supplemented diet (1 kg/kg diet). The third group fed on a formulated diet without supplement, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> and digestive enzymes were given in drinking water (0.1 ml/L). The fourth one was the heat stress group, with a normal formulated diet. The fifth and the sixth groups served as second and third groups, respectively, but with heat stress. The results of this experiment indicated that thermal temperature negatively affected the parameters of growth performance, serum biochemical, tissue antioxidants, and phagocytic assay. Moreover, heat stress led to pathological lesions in the internal organs and affected the expression of some genes related to heat stress, including proapoptotic genes such as caspase8 and bax, inflammatory genes such as NF-κβ1, and heat shock protein such as HSP 70 in the bursal tissue. These bad effects and abnormalities were mitigated by <i>Ruminococcus</i> alone or with enzyme supplementation, which improved all the above-mentioned parameters.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of environmental temperature and dietary Zn on egg production performance, egg quality and antioxidant status, as well as expression of heat-shock proteins (HSP) in tissues, of laying broiler breeders, we used a completely randomised design with a 2×3 factorial arrangement of treatments. The two environmental temperatures were normal (21±1°C, NT) and high (32±1°C, HT). The three dietary Zn sources were a Zn-unsupplemented basal diet (CON), and the basal diet supplemented with 110 mg Zn/kg as either the inorganic Zn sulphate (iZn) or the organic Zn proteinate with a moderate chelation strength (oZn). HT decreased (P<0·002) egg weight, laying rate, eggshell strength, thickness and weight, but increased (P≤0·05) rectal temperature, broken egg rate, misshapen egg rate, feed:egg ratio, Cu Zn superoxide dismutase activities in liver and pancreas, as well as metallothionein (MT) level in pancreas, and HSP70 mRNA levels in liver and pancreas of laying broiler breeders. Broiler breeders fed the oZn diet had higher (P<0·04) Zn content in the liver, as well as MT levels in the liver and pancreas, compared with those fed the CON diet. Under HT, broiler breeders fed the oZn diet had higher (P<0·05) Zn content in the pancreas compared with those fed the iZn and CON diets. The results from this study indicated that HT impaired egg production performance and eggshell quality possibly because of the disturbed redox balance and HSP homoeostasis, whereas the oZn is more available than the iZn for pancreatic Zn of heat-stressed laying broiler breeders.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to compare the effects of increasing concentrations of dietary threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), and glycine (Gly) on growth performance, stress biomarkers, and intestinal function in broiler chickens under multiple stress conditions. Five hundred sixty broiler chickens at 21 d old were randomly allotted to 5 treatments with 8 replicates. Birds in a positive control (PC) treatment were raised under low stock density (16.9 birds/m<sup>2</sup> per cage) with recommended environmental conditions, whereas birds in 4 treatments were subjected to multiple stress conditions: a cyclic heat stress of 30 ± 0.3 °C for 10 h and 23 ± 0.2 °C for 14 h per day with high stock density (25.3 birds/m<sup>2</sup> per cage). A basal diet was assigned to both PC and negative control (NC) treatments. Three additional diets were individually formulated to contain double concentrations of digestible Thr, Trp, or Gly + Ser compared with their concentrations in the basal diet. The experiment lasted for 14 d. Results showed that NC treatment had less growth performance (<i>P</i> < 0.001), jejunal goblet cell counts (<i>P</i> = 0.018), and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER; <i>P</i> < 0.001), but greater (<i>P</i> = 0.026) feather corticosterone (CORT) concentrations than PC treatment. Thr treatment showed the least (<i>P</i> < 0.001) feed conversion ratio (FCR) among treatments under multiple stress conditions. Thr, Trp, and Gly treatments had less (<i>P</i> = 0.026) feather CORT concentrations, but had greater (<i>P</i> < 0.001) TEER than NC treatment. In conclusion, increasing concentrations of dietary Thr, Trp, or Gly improve the growth performance and intestinal health in broiler chickens with decreasing stress response under multiple stress conditions.",

It also investigated the effects on the activity of digestive enzymes, microbiological composition, and the expression of antioxidant and tight junction-related proteins. Three hundred- and fifty-day-old male broilers, were randomly assigned to 7 treatment groups, with each group comprising 5 replicates, and each replicate containing 10 chicks in a cage. The diets were: 1) a basal diet, 2) a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg of rosemary, 3) a diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of rosemary, 4) a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg of oregano, 5) a diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of oregano, 6) a combination diet containing 50 mg/kg each of rosemary and oregano, and 7) a combination diet containing 100 mg/kg each of rosemary and oregano. Dietary oregano extract enhanced the growth and feed utilization of heat-stressed birds, especially at a concentration of 50 mg/kg. Moreover, oregano extract improved jejunal protease and amylase activities. The extracts of rosemary and oregano significantly reduced IgG and IgM levels. Dietary 50 mg oregano extract significantly upregulated intestinal integrity-related genes including jejunal CLDNI, ZO-1, ZO-2, and MUC2. Dietary 50 mg oregano extract significantly downregulated hepatic NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expressions. Our results suggest that incorporating oregano leaf extract into the diet at a concentration of 50 mg/kg improves the growth performance of broilers exposed to heat stress. This improvement could be attributed to enhanced gut health and the modulation of genes associated with oxidative stress and tight junction proteins.",

    "abstract": "The broiler industry is adversely affected by the rise in global temperature. This study investigated the effects of in ovo feeding of α-ketoglutaric acid (AKG) on growth performance, organ weight, plasma metabolite, plasma oxidative stress, rectal temperature (RT), and hepatic mRNA expression of antioxidant-related genes in Arbor Acres broilers subjected to cyclic heat stress (HS). Three hundred fifty fertile eggs during incubation were divided into 5 groups according to AKG concentrations and temperature conditions. After dissolving AKG in distilled water at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, 0% AKG was in ovo administered to 2 of the 5 groups whereas the remaining 3 groups received 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%, respectively. From d 29 to 34 of age, 4 groups of birds received heat stress (HS) at 31°C ± 1°C for 6 h per day while the other group was kept at room temperature (21°C ± 1°C; NT). So, the 5 treatment groups were: 1) 0AKG-NT, where chicks hatched from eggs receiving 0% AKG were reared under thermoneutral conditions. 2) 0AKG-HS, where chicks hatched from eggs receiving 0% AKG were reared under cyclic HS conditions. 3) 0.5AKG-HS, where chicks hatched from eggs receiving 0.5% AKG were reared under cyclic HS conditions. 4) 1.0AKG-HS, where chicks hatched from eggs receiving 1.0% AKG were reared under cyclic HS conditions. 5) 1.5AKG-HS, where chicks hatched from eggs receiving 1.5% AKG were reared under cyclic HS conditions. HS significantly reduced body weight change (ΔBW %) and average daily gain (ADG) without affecting average daily feed intake (ADFI). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly increased (P = 0.003) in all HS-treated groups. A significant linear decrease in the final RT (P = 0.005) and a change in RT (P = 0.003) were detected with increasing AKG concentration. Total antioxidant capacity (P = 0.029) and antioxidant balance (P = 0.001) in plasma increased linearly with increasing AKG concentration whereas malondialdehyde concentrations were linearly decreased (P = 0.001). Hepatic gene expression of CAT (P = 0.026) and GPX1 (P = 0.001) were dose-dependently upregulated while nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX)1, NOX4, and heat shock protein (HSP)70 were linearly downregulated (P < 0.05). Hence, in ovo injection of AKG was effective in mitigating HS-induced oxidative stress without attenuating the adverse effects on broiler growth.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbes play a significant role in digestion, developing immunity, and intestinal health. Therefore, direct-fed microbials are used to modify gut microbiota, maintain a healthy digestive system, enhance immunity, and promote the broilers' performance. In addition, it has a role in improving the utilization of unconventional feed ingredients (olive pulp, OP). This study provides the potential role of Aspergillus awamori in enhancing gut microbial content, nutrient utilization, growth performance, and antioxidative status in heat-stressed broiler chickens fed diets containing olive pulp. Three hundred chicks (Ross 308; one day old) were divided into four treatment groups (75 chick/ group) randomly, as follows; CON: chicks fed a basal diet based on corn and soybean meal, OP<sub>10</sub>: chicks fed a diet containing 10% OP, OA1: chicks fed a diet containing OP with A. awamori at 100 mg per kg, OA2: chicks fed a diet containing OP with A. awamori at 200 mg per kg. Adding A. awamori to the broiler diet that contains OP had a positive effect on productive performance via enhancing nutrition digestibility, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and carcass characteristics. A. awamori supplementation had a positive impact on immune responses by increasing serum immunoglobulin G and the relative weight of bursa of Fabricius (P < 0.05) compared to the other groups. Chickens fed A. awamori showed a noticeable improvement in the oxidative status through the increase in the level of serum superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, and the decrease in the level of malondialdehyde. Feeding A. awamori also modified the intestinal microbial content by increasing the population of Lactobacillus (P < 0.05). Our study indicated that adding 200 mg A. awamori reduced the negative effect of heat stress by modifying the microbial content of the intestine, immune response, and enhancing feed utilization, thus improving broiler performance, as well as, improving the nutritional value of the olive pulp. Therefore, adding A. awamori to the OP diet can be effectively used in heat-stressed broiler diets.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the individual and combined effects of a high dietary n-3 PUFA intake and cyclic heat stress (HS) on the carcass characteristics, meat quality, and oxidative stability of broiler breast meat and the potential of antioxidant supplementation (vitamins E, C, and selenium) to mitigate these effects. A total of 192 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned to 24 pens within two controlled environment chambers and fed with the following diets: a basal diet low in antioxidants according to NRC recommendations (NRC group), a basal diet according to Aviagen recommendations additionally supplemented with 200 IU/kg vitamin E, 250 mg/kg vitamin C, and 0.15 mg/kg selenium (HAOX group), and these two diets further supplemented with 5% linseed oil (NRC N-3 and HAOX N-3 groups). On day 22, the broilers were exposed to the following two environmental conditions: thermoneutral (TN, 21 °C) or cyclic HS (HS, 34 ± 1 °C, 7 h/d) in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design. A high intake of n-3 PUFAs significantly decreased growth performance, dressing percentage, and breast yield, while the incidence of pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) meat characteristics and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased. Cyclic HS reduced body weight (BW) and average daily feed intake (ADFI), but had limited effects on meat quality. No interactions between n-3 PUFAs and HS were observed for any measurements. High antioxidant supplementation increased breast yield, improved meat quality, and reduced oxidative stress, as evidenced by an enhanced antioxidant activity and lower MDA levels. In conclusion, n-3 PUFAs had a negative effect on both the carcass characteristics and meat quality of broilers, while HS primarily affected only carcass characteristics, with neither stressor having severe adverse effects. High levels of antioxidants could mitigate the negative effects of dietary- and heat-induced oxidative stress by enhancing the oxidative stability of broiler meat.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the potential of insect-based diets to mitigate heat stress impact on broiler chickens, focusing on growth performance and antioxidant stability. Four dietary groups were examined, including a control and three treated groups with Tenebrio molitor (TM), Hermetia illucens (HI), and Zophobas morio (ZM) larvae, respectively, at a 5% replacement ratio. Temperature and relative humidity of the poultry house were monitored. Under heat stress conditions, the HI-fed group consistently exhibited the highest body weight, demonstrating their remarkable growth-promoting potential. TM-fed broilers also displayed commendable growth compared to the control. Insect larvae inclusion in the diet improved feed intake during early growth stages, indicating their positive influence on nutrient utilization. Regarding antioxidant stability, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver, an oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation marker, were significantly lower in the TM-fed group, suggesting reduced oxidative stress. While the specific insect-based diet did not significantly affect MDA levels in thigh and breast tissues, variations in the total phenolic content (TPC) were observed across tissues, with HI larvae significantly increasing it in the breast. However, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) levels did not differ significantly among dietary groups in the examined tissues. Results suggest that insect-based diets enhance broiler growth and potentially reduce oxidative stress, particularly in the liver. Dietary presence of bioactive compounds may contribute to these benefits. Further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying these findings. Insect-based diets seem to offer promise as feed additives in addressing the multifaceted challenges of oxidative stress and enhancing broiler health and resilience under heat stress conditions.",

Six groups were established: CHP (24°C+210 g/kg crude protein (CP)), SHP (34°C+210 g/kg CP), CLP (24°C+190 g/kg CP), SLP (34°C+190 g/kg CP), SHPVE (34°C+210 g/kg CP+Vitamin E) and SLPVE (34°C+190 g/kg CP+Vitamin E) groups. 3. It was determined that the body weights of the male animals included in Group CHP displayed statistically significant differences in comparison to those of Groups SHP, CLP and SLP. Furthermore, it was ascertained that the values of Group CLP also displayed statistically significant differences in comparison to those of Groups CHP, SHP and SLP. The feed consumptions in Groups CHP and CLP were significantly different from those of the remaining groups, excluding Group SHP. The highest feed conversion rate was determined in Group SHPVE. 4. When evaluated for chicken drumstick TBA values, Group CHP differed significantly from Groups SHP, SHPVE, CLP and SLP, whilst Group CLP differed significantly from Groups SHP, SHPVE and SLP. On the other hand, when evaluated for breast meat TBA values, Group CHP displayed statistically significant differences in comparison to Groups SHP, SLP and SLPVE, whilst Group CLP differed significantly from Groups CHP, SHP, SLP and SLPVE. 5. The sensitivity of breast meat to colour susceptibility was greater than that of chicken drumsticks. While storage period affected the TBA values and microbial counts of meat significantly, its effect on colour parameters was found to be variable. Trial groups significantly affected total aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts in chicken drumsticks, and Enterobacteriaceae and total aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts in breast meat. 6. In conclusion, heat stress adversely affected final body weights and the lipid oxidation of meat, whilst vitamin E alleviated these adverse effects.",

    "title": "Effects of free and dipeptide forms of methionine supplementation on oxidative metabolism of broilers under high temperature.",
    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that methionine supplementation could help to attenuate the effects of heat stress on the metabolism of broiler chickens. Here we investigated for the first time the effects of methionine supplementation in the form of DL-methionyl-DL-methionine on broilers subjected to heat stress during the growth phase. Broilers were divided into two groups; one group was reared under thermoneutral conditions and the other under continuous heat stress (30 ± 1 °C, 60% relative humidity). Both groups were subdivided into three dietary treatments: a methionine-deficient (MD) diet, a diet supplemented with free methionine (DL-M), and a diet supplemented with methionine dipeptide (DL-MM). Broilers raised under chronic heat stress had lower feed intake and weight gain than broilers raised under thermoneutral conditions (P < 0.05). There were no differences in animal performance between methionine-supplemented diets (DL-M and DL-MM). Heat-stressed birds had significantly higher heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio than thermoneutral birds. Under heat stress, broilers fed DL-M and DL-MM diets had lower H/L ratio than birds fed the MD diet. Higher concentrations of carbonylated proteins and lower concentration of reduced glutathione were observed in broilers raised under heat stress. In comparing heat-stressed broilers, we found that birds fed the DL-M diet had lower concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and carbonylated proteins than those fed the MD diet (P < 0.05). Higher expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione synthetase (GSS) genes was observed in heat-stressed broilers (P < 0.05). Under heat stress, the MD diet increased GPX expression compared with other diets. Under thermoneutral conditions, the DL-M diet resulted in the highest GSS expression. There was a negative correlation between DNA methylation and GPX and GSS expression. Our results showed that supplementation of broiler diets with free methionine or methionine dipeptide may help attenuate the effects of heat stress through enhanced activation of genes related to the glutathione antioxidant system. Methionine effects were found for gene regulation, gene expression, and post-translational processing.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate the effect of increasing supplementation of dietary glycine (Gly) on growth performance, meat quality, liver characteristics, and intestinal health in broiler chickens raised under heat stress (HS) conditions. A total of one thousand six hundred 25-d-old broiler chickens were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments with 8 replicates. Each replicate comprised 20 male and 20 female birds. A negative control (NC) diet was prepared to meet or exceed energy and nutrient requirement estimates, whereas a positive control (PC) diet was formulated to contain increasing concentrations of AME<sub>n</sub> by 50 kcal/kg as well as those of digestible amino acids, total Ca, and available P by 10% compared with the respective concentrations in the NC diet. Three additional diets were prepared by supplementing the NC diet with 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6% Gly. All chickens were raised under cyclic HS conditions at 29°C ± 0.89°C for 10 h/d and 23°C ± 1.45°C for the remaining time over an 18-d feeding trial. Results indicated that broiler chickens fed the NC diet had a greater (P < 0.05) FCR than those fed the PC diet under HS conditions. Increasing supplementation of up to 1.6% Gly in diets decreased (linear, P < 0.001) FCR in broiler chickens. Increasing supplementation of dietary Gly tended to increase (linear, P = 0.070) water holding capacity in the breast meat. Increasing supplementation of dietary Gly decreased (linear, P < 0.05) serum aspartate aminotransferase concentrations and tended to decrease blood heterophil:lymphocyte (linear, P = 0.083) and liver malondialdehyde concentrations (quadratic, P = 0.084). A tendency for increased villus height (linear, P = 0.086) and a significant increase in villus height:crypt depth ratio and goblet cell numbers (linear, P < 0.05) were identified following increasing Gly supplementation. In conclusion, increasing supplementation of dietary Gly improved feed efficiency, meat quality, liver health, and intestinal morphology possibly by mitigating oxidative stress and stress response in broiler chickens raised under HS conditions.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "In this study, the aim was to investigate effects of chronic heat stress (CHS) on the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]), toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4), heat shock proteins (Hsp70, heat shock transcription factor [HSF]-1, and HSF3) and antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, NADPH oxidase, and superoxide-dismutase) in the jejunal mucosae of broiler chickens subjected to thermal manipulation (TM) during embryogenesis. TM was carried out at 39°C and 65% relative humidity (RH) for 18 h daily from embryonic days 10 to 18. Control group was incubated at 37.8°C and 56% RH. CHS was induced by raising the temperature to 35°C for 7 D throughout posthatch days 28 to 35. On post-hatch-day 28 (day zero of CHS) and after 1, 3, 5, and 7 D of CHS, the jejunal mucosae were collected from both groups to evaluate the mRNA levels by real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. On day zero of CHS, the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, TLRs, HSF3, IL-1β, and TNF-α were not significantly different between TM and control groups, while the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and HSF1 were lower and the level of Hsp70 was higher in TM. However, during CHS, the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, IL-1β, TNF-α, TLR4, and HSF1 were significantly lower in TM than in controls, while the levels of TLR2 and IL-8 were significantly higher in TM than in controls. In addition, TM led to significant increase of mRNA levels of IL-6 and HSF3 after 1 D and Hsp70 after 3 D of CHS and to significant decrease of mRNA levels of IL-6 after 3 and 5 D, HSF3 after 7 D, and Hsp70 after 5 D of CHS. Results of this study suggest that TM led to altered posthatch antioxidant, immunological, and Hsp response to CHS in the jejunal mucosae of broiler chickens, probably indicating that TM may mitigate the adverse effects of CHS.",

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "It was hypothesized that dietary guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), the precursor of creatine (Cr), would be beneficial to heat-stressed finisher broilers owing to improved cellular energy status and arginine sparing effects. A total of 720 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were allocated to 3 treatments, 0 (control), 0.6, or 1.2 g/kg of GAA added to complete corn-soybean meal diets, and were fed for 39 D, with 12 replicates (20 birds each) per treatment. A chronic cyclic heat stress model (at a temperature of 34°C and 50 to 60% relative humidity for 7 h daily) was applied in the finisher phase (day 25-39). Samples were taken on day 26 and 39 to determine thrombocyte, white blood cell, corticosterone, protein and amino acid levels in blood and Cr, phosphocreatine (PCr), and adenosine triphosphate levels in the breast muscle. Meat quality was assessed on day 40 after overnight fasting. Guanidinoacetic acid at a dose of 1.2 g/kg decreased feed-to-gain ratio compared with the control in the grower phase (1.32 vs. 1.35, respectively; P <0.05). In the finisher period, the supplementation of 1.2 g/kg of GAA reduced feed intake compared with the control (-3.3%, P <0.05), whereas both GAA supplementation levels improved feed efficiency markedly (1.76, 1.66, and 1.67 for 0 [control], 0.6, and 1.2 g/kg of GAA, respectively, P <0.05). Mortality outcomes highlight that GAA feeding improved survival during heat stress, supported by lower panting frequency (linear effect, P <0.05). Plasma arginine was higher with increase in dietary GAA concentration on day 26 (+18.3 and + 30.8% for 0.6 and 1.2 g/kg of GAA, respectively; P <0.05). This suggests enhanced availability of arginine for other metabolic purposes than de novo GAA formation. In the breast muscle, PCr (day 39, P <0.05), free Cr (day 39, P <0.05), total Cr (both days, P <0.05), and PCr-to-adenosine triphosphate ratio (day 39, P <0.05) levels were increased with higher GAA content in diet. Guanidinoacetic acid supplementation improved feed conversion and survival during chronic cyclic heat stress, which may be associated with enhanced breast muscle energy status and arginine sparing effect.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Moringa oleifera (MO) on the performance, antioxidative status, and immune related gene expression in broilers raised under normal or heat stress conditions. Broiler chickens were distributed into 4 groups and fed diets with dietary MO at 0% or 5% (MO0 or MO5) and raised under ambient temperature 22 ± 1 °C (N) or 35±1 °C (HS). HS conditions negatively affected the weight gain and FCR, while feeding MO exhibited beneficial effects especially under HS conditions. Triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in chickens raised in HS conditions and fed the basal diet than those in normal condition and fed with or without MO, while MO decreased triglycerides and total cholesterol levels in normal and HS conditions. Blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) was significantly decreased in broilers raised in HS conditions and fed diets without MO, while MO increased HDL level. Blood glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in broilers raised in HS conditions and fed the basal diet without MO. mRNA expression of GSH-Px was significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in broilers raised in HS conditions and fed diets without MO. Broilers under normal or HS conditions and fed the basal diet exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated mRNA expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) compared to chickens under normal conditions and fed MO. Liver and muscle thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARs) were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in broilers under HS conditions and fed diet without MO. The expressions of interleukins (IL2 and IL6) were significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in broilers under normal or HS conditions and fed diets without MO. To sum up, HS conditions depressed the performance, antioxidative status, and immune related gene expression in broilers, while MO obviously alleviated these negative effects in broilers.",

    "abstract": "This study hypothesizes that in ovo sulfur amino acids (SAA) injection can alleviate the heat or oxidative stress of hatched chicks. Thus, the study aimed to assess the impact of in ovo injection of SAA with heat stress during the incubation on heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), corticosterone hormone, antioxidant indices, and lipid profile of newly hatched broiler chicks. Eggs were incubated under optimal incubation temperature (37.8°C) from days 1 to 10 then under high temperature (39.6°C for 6 h daily) between 10 and 18 D of the incubation. At day 17.5 of incubation, 150 eggs were randomly divided into 3 groups of 50 replicate eggs. The first group served as control (non-injected group, NIG), the second group was only injected with saline solution (saline-injected group, SIG), and the third group was injected with a mixture of 5.90 mg L-methionine plus 3.40 mg L-cysteine (sulfur amino acids-injected group, SAAIG). The results exhibited that serum HSP70 and corticosterone concentrations were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in the SAAIG compared with the NIG and SIG. In ovo SAA injection significantly augmented the antioxidant indices in the serum and tissues compared with the NIG and SIG. HSP70 mRNA relative expression was decreased but glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) mRNA relative expression was augmented in the tested tissues (P < 0.001) in the SAAIG compared with the NIG. The SAAIG had significantly (P < 0.05) lower levels in serum lipid profile compared to those of the control and SIG. In conclusion, in ovo SAA injection (methionine plus cysteine) in the embryonated eggs exposed to heat stress increased GSH-Px gene expression and antioxidant indices, and reduced HSP70 gene expression, corticosterone concentrations, and lipid profile of newly hatched broiler chicks.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "An experiment was carried out to assess the efficacy of supplemental ascorbic acid (AA) on broiler chicken production performance, blood haematological profile, biochemical profile, and carcass traits under heat stress conditions. A total of 192-day-old broiler chicks were divided into four groups, each with six replicates of eight each (4 × 6 × 8). Four corn-based dietary treatments were formulated: T<sub>1</sub> (control diet), T<sub>2</sub> (T<sub>1</sub> + AA at 200 mg/kg), T<sub>3</sub> (T<sub>1</sub> + AA at 400 mg/kg), and T<sub>4</sub> (T<sub>1</sub> + AA at 600 mg/kg) for a period of 42 days. Despite the high temperature and humidity, the 600 mg AA supplemental groups (T<sub>4</sub>) gained significantly (P ≤ 0.05) more body weight and had a higher feed intake and better feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the control group (T<sub>1</sub>). After 28 days of feeding the three AA-supplemented diets, antibody titres (humoral immune response) were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05). The response to intradermally injected phyto-haemagglutinin (PHA-P), an index of the in vivo cell-mediated immune response, was found to be increased (P ≤ 0.05) in the 400 and 600 mg AA-supplemented groups after 35 days. Higher levels of AA (T<sub>4</sub>) supplementation significantly (P ≤ 0.05) improved haematological values such as haemoglobin (Hb), total erythrocyte count (TEC), total leukocyte count (TLC), and differential leukocyte count (DLC), heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) in comparison to the control group (T<sub>1</sub>). The supplemented group improved the serum biochemical profile of the birds, with an increase (P ≤ 0.05) in total serum protein, albumin, and globulin and a decrease in serum cholesterol and corticosterone levels in the T<sub>4</sub> group compared to the control group. Heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) was gradually elevated after increasing the ascorbic acid concentration (P ≤ 0.05) at 14 and 21 days. As a result, it can be concluded that supplementing ascorbic acid at 600 mg/kg is beneficial for improving the performance, immunity, and blood haematological biochemical profile and upregulating the HSP-70 gene of broiler chickens under heat stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "The trial was aimed at assessing the effect of phytogenic feed additive (PFA), a natural adaptogen, on growth performance, serum neopterin level, and cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) response in heat-induced stress model of broilers. One-day-old Ross 308 chicks (<i>N</i> = 360) were randomly distributed among normal control (NOR), heat-stress control (HSC), and PFA treatment (HSC plus PFA at 200 gm/ton of feed) group. HSC and PFA groups were subjected to heat stress (HS) (32°C-36°C) from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. for 35 days. The impact of HS on growth performance, serum neopterin level, and CBH response was assessed. High ambient temperature worsened the performance traits [bodyweight (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and feed conversion ratio] and significantly lowered the serum neopterin level and CBH response in the HSC group when compared to the NOR group. However, supplementation of PFA at 200 gm/ton of feed to birds mitigated the detrimental effects of HS. PFA at 200 gm/ton demonstrated the immunomodulatory effect through the restoration of serum neopterin level, CBH response, and growth performance traits in heat-stressed broiler chickens. Thus, PFA can be used as a natural adaptogen to increase the stress resistance and mitigate the negative <i>consequences</i> of various stressors in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the chronic heat stress (CHS) broiler model was developed to investigate the potential protection mechanism of organic selenium (selenomethionine, SeMet) on CHS-induced skeletal muscle growth retardation and poor meat quality. Four hundred Arbor Acres male broilers (680 ± 70 g, 21 d old) were grouped into 5 treatments with 8 replicates of 10 broilers per replicate. Broilers in the control group were raised in a thermoneutral environment (22 ± 2 °C) and fed with a basal diet. The other four treatments were exposed to hyperthermic conditions (33 ± 2 °C, 24 h in each day) and fed on the basal diet supplied with SeMet at 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg Se/kg, respectively, for 21 d. Results showed that CHS reduced (<i>P <</i> 0.05) the growth performance, decreased (<i>P <</i> 0.05) the breast muscle weight and impaired the meat quality of breast muscle in broilers. CHS induced protein metabolic disorder in breast muscle, which increased (<i>P <</i> 0.05) the expression of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and ubiquitin proteasome system related genes, while decreased the protein expression of P-4EBP1. CHS also decreased the antioxidant capacity and induced mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in breast muscle, which increased (<i>P <</i> 0.05) the ROS levels, decreased the concentration of ATP, increased the protein expression of HSP60 and CLPX, and increased (<i>P <</i> 0.05) the expression of ER stress biomarkers. Dietary SeMet supplementation linearly increased (<i>P <</i> 0.05) breast muscle Se concentration and exhibited protective effects via up-regulating the expression of the selenotranscriptome and several key selenoproteins, which increased (<i>P</i> < 0.05) body weight, improved meat quality, enhanced antioxidant capacity and mitigated mitochondrial stress and ER stress. What's more, SeMet suppressed protein degradation and improved protein biosynthesis though inhibiting the caspase and ubiquitin proteasome system and promoting the mTOR-4EBP1 pathway. In conclusion, dietary SeMet supplementation increases the expression of several key selenoproteins, alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, improves protein biosynthesis, suppresses protein degradation, thus increases the body weight and improves meat quality of broilers exposed to CHS.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional modification strategies have become pivotal in addressing heat stress in poultry farming. Probiotics are increasingly recognized as a sustainable additive by researchers. The enhancement of antioxidant capacity is critical for improving the overall health and productivity of broilers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which probiotics influence antioxidant functions in heat-stressed broilers remain unclear. Consequently, this study raised 400 one day old Arbor Acres broilers until 28 d. Among them, 300 broilers, showing no significant weight differences (P > 0.05), were randomly divided into three groups (control, heat stress, and heat stress with probiotics), each consisting of five replicates with 20 broilers per replicate. The heat stress conditions were maintained at 32 ± 1°C from 9:00 to 17:00, and at 21 ± 1°C during the remaining hours, identical to the control conditions. The heat stress with probiotics group received a basal diet supplemented with 10 g/kg of compound probiotics (Lactobacillus casei: Lactobacillus acidophilus: Bifidobacterium at a ratio of 1:1:2). All groups had ad libitum access to food and water over the 14-day experimental period. Results indicated that the compound probiotics enhanced growth performance and antioxidant capacity, increasing levels of glutathione peroxidase and catalase. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified Hub genes (e.g., PANK2, FAM167A, ABCG8, DYDC2), Hub metabolites (e.g., l-glutamine, ornithine), and Hub microorganisms (e.g., Burkholderia, Macromonas) that regulate antioxidant functions in heat-stressed broilers. By integrating the WGCNA results, we constructed a \"microbe-metabolite-gene\" regulatory network centered around co-enriched pathways, illustrating the interrelationships between molecules. Notably, NT5C1A, GDA,l-glutamine, and guanosine were notably enriched in purine metabolism, whereas ABCG8,l-arginine, allose, and deoxyguanosine were prominently enriched in ABC transporters pathways, highlighting their crucial involvement in orchestrating the antioxidant response to heat stress. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which compound probiotics enhance antioxidant functions in heat-stressed broilers, offering a theoretical foundation for probiotic applications in poultry.",

The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine the effects of an amino acid-chelated trace mineral supplement on growth performance, stress and inflammatory markers, and meat quality in heat-stressed broilers. One day-old Cobb 500 male broilers (n = 480) were allocated into 12 environmental chambers (24 floor pens) and divided into two groups: one group supplemented with amino acid-chelated trace mineral in drinking water and one control group. On day 28, birds were subjected to chronic heat stress (HS, 2 wk, 35 °C and 20% to 30% RH) or maintained at thermoneutral condition (TN, 24 °C) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Feed intake (FI), water consumption, and body weight were recorded. At day 42, serum fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-D) levels, blood gas, electrolyte, and stress markers were measured. Jejunum samples were collected to measure gene expression of stress, inflammation, and tight junction proteins. The rest of the birds were processed to evaluate carcass traits. HS resulted in an increase in core body temperature, which increased water intake and decreased FI, body weight, and feed efficiency (P < 0.05). HS reduced carcass yield and the weight of all parts (P < 0.05). HS significantly increased levels of circulating corticosterone (CORT), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), interleukin 18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 expression. HS significantly increased serum FITC-D levels and the expression of HSP70 and IL-18 in the jejunum. Although it did not affect the growth performance, amino acid-chelated trace mineral supplementation reversed the effect of HS by reducing CORT and FITC-D levels and the expression of stress and proinflammatory cytokines in the circulation and the jejunum. However, it upregulated these parameters in birds maintained under TN conditions. Together, these data indicate that the amino acid-chelated trace mineral might alleviate stress and inflammation and improve gut integrity in heat-stressed but not thermoneutral broilers.",

A total of 2,240 straight-run one-day-old chickens were sorted by weight, randomized among 28 floor pens with 80 chickens per pen and 7 replicates for each treatment. Birds were assigned to one of 4 dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with two temperature environments (moderate and high) and without or with Essential supplementation (1.5 kg/ton). Variances for the average temperature, relative humidity, and dew point for the two environments were different (P < 0.001), showing that the high-temperature environment reached higher temperatures and dew points. Essential supplementation increased body weight gain at 42 D of age (2.548 vs. 2.508 kg; P < 0.01) and tended to improve feed conversion (1.621 vs. 1.644; P = 0.09) independent of temperature environment. The high-temperature environment increased mortality (7.5 vs. 12.4%; P = 0.03) and carcass yields (77.5 vs. 76.2%; P < 0.01). Breast yields were affected by an environment by Essential interaction (P < 0.01).

Finally, breast yields were increased by Essential supplementation (23.6 vs. 22.9%; P < 0.01) regardless of the ambient temperature. In conclusion, Essential supplementation improved weight gains and carcass characteristics, and high-temperature environments decreased breast yields when Essential was not supplemented.",

    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "Poultry is highly sensitive to oxidative reactions. Oxidative reactions have attracted considerable attention from animal and food scientists because of the adverse effects of these reactions on animal welfare, performance and food quality. Despite its implication in multiple biological functions magnesium (Mg) supplementation is typically overlooked in broiler diets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Mg supplementation (0.3%) using a commercial product (Optibreast<sup>®</sup>) on production parameters, the redox status and meat quality in broilers challenged with dietary (oxidized oil) and heat stress. The incidence of myopathies, namely, wooden breast (WB) and white striping (WS) was also assessed. Mg supplementation had a clear interaction with the absorption/accumulation of Ca in blood and breast muscle but this effect had no negative influence on any of the production parameters under study. Mg supplementation had positive effects on particular meat quality traits such as water holding capacity (WHC) and color. WHC may have other positive effects in turn on relevant sensory traits such as juiciness. Mg supplementation protected against protein oxidation in liver and plasma of broilers. This effect may be related to the increased activity of catalase in such tissues. Mg supplementation reduced the incidence of WS and WB myopathies to almost half the occurrence of such defects in animals fed a control diet. Further studies with a larger number of animals and the application of advanced proteomic/metabolomic tools are required to (1) corroborate the positive influence of Mg on myopathy incidence and (2) identify the underlying molecular basis of the proposed mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress has various detrimental effects on poultry production. The aim of the study was to alleviate the effects of heat stress in broiler production. For this purpose, 288 one-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were obtained from a commercial hatchery and randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups; CON: corn-soybean meal based commercial diet, SEO100: CON with 100 mg/kg Sage essential oil (SEO) and SEO200: CON with 200 mg/kg SEO with 96 birds in each group (4 replicates each) in a completely randomized design under hot ambient temperatures for 42 days. No differences were observed in the body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio at 42 days of age among groups. However, there was a significant increase in 21-day body weight in SEO200 chicks compared to CON. Furthermore, the addition of SEO significantly decreased the mortality rate under heat stress conditions. The total oxidant status value was lower in broiler chickens in which SEO was added to their diets. While the total antioxidant status value was higher in SEO100 chicks, it did not show a linear increase. Additionally, the results demonstrated that the addition of SEO to broiler diets under heat stress did not have a significant effect on inspected meat quality traits, with the exception of the b*(yellowness) value of breast muscle. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that 200 mg/kg SEO can be added to diets for the welfare of broiler chickens under heat stress conditions for struggling with oxidants and increasing viability. Further research is needed to investigate the antioxidant activity and meat quality of different levels of SEO in hot ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a dietary synbiotic inclusion on broiler bone health under daily cyclic heat stress. A total of 360 Ross 708 broilers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments (8 replicates per treatment): a regular diet (control) and the regular diet mixed with a commercial synbiotic product at 0.5 (0.5X) or 1.0 (1.0X) g/kg. The synbiotic contains a prebiotic (fructooligosaccharides) and a probiotic mixture of 4 microbial strains (Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Lactobacillus reuteri). Room temperature was gradually decreased from 34°C on d 1 by 0.5°C/d for the first 14 d; then a cyclic heat stress episode (32°C/9 h/d) was applied from d 15 to 42. Gait score assessment and the latency-to-lie test were conducted when broilers were 40 and 41 d of age, respectively. The tibia, femur, and humerus were collected for measuring bone parameters at 42 d of age. The data indicated that bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and bone area were higher and the level of gait score was lower in the 1.0X group (P = 0.05) but not in the 0.5X group (P > 0.05) compared to controls. The proportions of broilers showing signs of lameness were ranked 1.0X group (25%) < 0.5X group (45%) < control (54%). Compared to controls, broilers of 0.5X group stood longer (P = 0.03) during the latency-to-lie test. In conclusion, under the present conditions the synbiotic profoundly improves multiple indices of leg health of broilers subjected to the cyclic heat episodes, resulting in an improvement in walking ability.",

A total of 240 (day old) Cornish male BR and 50 (19 wk old) White Leghorn Shavers LH were allotted in 5 dietary treatments with 6 and 10 cages/treatment (8 BR or 1 LH/cage), respectively. The birds were fed corn-soybean meal basal diets supplemented with microalgal (Haematococcus pluvialis) AST at 0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg diet for 6 wk. Supplemental AST to the BR diet linearly decreased (P < 0.10, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.18-0.36) hepatic mRNA levels of several redox status-controlling genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSTF1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). The supplementation linearly elevated (P = 0.04, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.20) diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) mRNA level and produced quadratic changes (P < 0.10, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.15-0.47) in mRNA levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST), serine/threonine kinase (AKT1), P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38MAKP), lipid metabolism-controlling genes, and the protein production of HSP90 and P38MAPK in the liver. Supplementing AST to the LH diets linearly decreased (P < 0.10, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.18-0.56) mRNA levels of GST, HSF1, JNK1, and interleukin 10; lipogenesis genes; and JNK1 protein production. However, supplemental dietary AST produced quadratic changes (P < 0.10, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.26-0.72) in mRNA levels of most antioxidant-, stress-responsive, and lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver of LH. In conclusion, supplemental dietary AST affected the hepatic gene expression and protein production related to redox status, heat stress and inflammation, and lipid metabolism in both BR and LH. The impacts varied with the chicken type and demonstrated linear and quadratic regressions with the inclusion levels of AST.",

    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "The use of nanominerals, such as nano-zinc, represents a promising and emerging technology in the animal farming industry. Due to the small particle size and bioavailability of nano-zinc, it can be easily assimilated in the digestive system, thereby reducing excretion and environmental pollution. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on the growth performance, zinc (Zn) concentration in edible tissues, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, and corticosterone concentrations in broilers reared under normal or heat stress environmental conditions. The experiment was performed with a completely randomized design based on a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of 4 diets (basal diet + 60 mg/kg conventional zinc oxide as control diet; basal diet + 40 mg/kg of ZnONPs; basal diet + 60 mg/kg of ZnONPs; and basal diet + 100 mg/kg of ZnONPs) and 2 environmental conditions (normal and heat stress). On day 22, birds from each dietary group were divided equally to normal temperature (23 ± 1°C throughout) or heat stress conditions (34 ± 1°C daily for 6 h from 10:00 am until 4:00 pm). From 1 to 42 D of age, the broiler chickens fed 100 mg/kg ZnONPs exhibited lower feed intake and feed conversion ratio than the control. The accumulation of Zn in the liver of broilers was significantly higher among all treatment groups compared to breast and thigh muscle tissues regardless of the temperature conditions. At 40 and 60 mg/kg ZnONPs, the malondialdehyde content increased in thigh muscle of broilers at 7 D postmortem, indicating that ZnONPs potentially inhibited the antioxidant system in muscle tissues. The control and ZnONPs at 40 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg led to low serum corticosterone levels that may be attributed to the antioxidant and antistress properties of Zn. Taken together, although supplementation with ZnONPs at 40 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg alleviated the negative results of heat stress, further research is needed to determine the optimal level of dietary ZnONPs supplementation.",

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "High ambient temperature adversely influences poultry production. In the present study, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) supplementation was used to alleviate the adverse changes due to heat stress (HS) in a broiler chicken strain (Ross 308). At 21 days of age, the birds were divided into four groups of 13. Two groups were housed under normal room temperature, one group was given orally 0.2 ml 0.9% physiological saline (CN) daily, the other group received 0.2 ml of 0.5% GABA solution orally (GN). A third group was exposed to environmental HS (33 ± 1 °C lasting for 2 weeks) + physiological saline (CH) and a fourth group was exposed to HS + GABA supplementation (GH). GABA supplementation during HS significantly reduced the birds' increased body temperature (p <.0001) and increased their body weight gain (p <.0001). This effect was associated with increases in the heat stress-induced reductions in jejunal villus length, crypt depth and mucous membrane thickness, and decreases in the vascular changes occurred due to HS. Additionally, GABA supplementation significantly modulated HS-induced changes in glucose facilitated transporter 2 (GLUT2), peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) mRNA expression in the jejunal mucosa (p < .0001). GABA supplementation also significantly elevated the triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) hormone level and hemoglobin levels and decreased the heterophil-lymphocyte ratio (H/L ratio) (p <.0001). Furthermore, it induced higher hepatic glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GSH-Px) activities and decreased the malondialdehyde dehydrogenase (MDA) content. These results indicate that GABA supplementation during HS may be used to alleviate HS-related changes in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "The growing interest in countering the adverse effects of heat stress in poultry using phytogenic feed additives has garnered considerable attention in recent times, this research sought to examine the impact of rosemary leaves extract (RLE) and oregano leaves extract (OLE) on the growth performance, physiological responses, and hepatic mRNA expression of heat shock proteins in broiler chickens exposed to heat stress. A total of 150 male Indian River chicks, aged one day, were randomly allocated into five equally sized groups, each consisting of six replicates. The initial group was designated as the control and was provided with the basal diet. The second and third groups (R1 and R2) were administered the basal diet enriched with 50 and 100 mg/kg of rosemary leaves extract (RLE), respectively. The fourth and fifth groups (O1 and O2) were fed the basal diet supplemented with 50 and 100 mg/kg of oregano leaves extract (OLE), respectively. These chicks were reared in a controlled environmental chamber maintained at a temperature of 32±2 °C and relative humidity of 50 ± 5 %. Ferruginol was the leading component in RLE, whereas thymol was the prevalent constituent in OLE. RLE and OLE both have high DPPH• and ABTS•+ antioxidant potential. Among the experimental groups, the fourth group (O1) showed the heaviest live body weight and the lowest feed conversion ratio, indicating improved growth performance. There was a significant reduction in plasma total lipids and LDL-cholesterol levels within the R2 and O2 groups, respectively. Enhanced total antioxidant capacity and an improvement in the T3 hormone were observed in the R1 and R2 groups. In the second and fourth groups, the mRNA expression of hsp70 and 90A were both found to be significantly downregulated, respectively. In conclusion, the addition of 50 mg/kg of oregano leaves extract (OLE) to the diets of heat-stressed broilers resulted in improved hepatic heat shock proteins, along with certain physiological responses, ultimately contributing to enhanced growth performance.",

    "abstract": "Male broilers were used to evaluate the effect of zinc on performance and immune competence during heat stress (HS). Broilers raised in either a thermoneutral (TN, 23.9 degrees C constant) or HS (23.9 to 35 degrees C cycling) environment were fed a low zinc diet (LZ; 34 mg/kg), an adequate zinc diet (AZ; 68 mg/kg), or a supplemental zinc diet (HZ; 181 mg/kg). Humoral immunity was assessed by intravenous injection of 7% SRBC followed by evaluation of serum for antibody titers in primary and secondary responses. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed using a Sephadex stimulation method to recruit abdominal exudate cells (AEC) to evaluate macrophage phagocytic ability. The HS birds consumed 12.5% less feed, gained 24.6% less weight, and had lower feed efficiency when compared to TN birds. Dietary zinc levels did not impact growth performance or plasma zinc concentration. Numbers of AEC, macrophages in AEC, phagocytic macrophages, and internalized opsonized and unopsonized SRBC were increased by HZ. Total, IgM, and IgG antibody titers for primary and secondary responses were significantly increased in birds receiving HZ under TN conditions. Tibia zinc concentration increased with increasing zinc levels but did not change with temperature. Lymphoid organ weights, primary and secondary antibody responses, incidences of macrophages in AEC, phagocytic ability of macrophages, and plasma zinc concentration were all significantly reduced by HS. These results indicate that the immune response of broilers can be influenced by the level of zinc in the diet and by environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the use of natural antioxidant supplements in poultry diets as protection against the adverse effects of heat stress. The potential protective effect of boldo (<i>Peumus</i> <i>boldus molina</i>) leaf extract, which have antioxidant activity, were investigated against the harmful effects of heat stress in two broiler strains. Arbor Acres (AA) and Avian-48 (AV) chicks were divided into thermoneutral (TN) and heat stress (HS) groups and treated with 1 g boldo leaf extract/4 L drinking water during the heat stress period. HS reduced growth performance in both strains. The phagocytic index, phagocytic activity, and eosinophil and lymphocytes counts were significantly elevated in TN and HS AV birds but not altered in AA birds. Boldo extract treatment partially eliminated the previous negative impacts of heat stress. AA chicks were better able to withstand HS than AV chicks. Serum concentrations of total lipids and cholesterol were reduced in HS birds of both strains. Malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase levels were elevated but restored with the administration of boldo leaf extract in HS birds of both strains. Economic parameters were negatively affected by HS but restored to values close to those of the control group in boldo-treated HS birds. In conclusion, the administration of boldo leaf extract in drinking water was effective in neutralizing the harmful effects of heat stress on growth performance, blood indices, and economic parameters and improved the antioxidant defense system in heat-stressed birds.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of a dietary synbiotic supplement on the behavioral patterns and growth performance of broiler chickens exposed to heat stress (HS). Three hundred sixty 1-day-old male Ross 708 broiler chicks were distributed among 24 floor pens (15 chicks per pen); each pen was randomly assigned to one of 3 dietary treatments containing a synbiotic at 0 (control), 0.5 (0.5X) and 1.0 (1.0X) g/kg. From d 15 to 42, birds were exposed to HS at 32°C daily from 08:00 to 17:00. Five broiler chickens were randomly marked in each pen for behavioral observation. Instantaneous scan sampling was used to record the birds' behavioral patterns. Performance parameters were measured on d 7, 14, 28 and 42. The synbiotic fed birds exhibited more standing, sitting, walking, feeding, preening and less wing spreading and panting behaviors (P < 0.05) compared to birds fed the control diet. The synbiotic group also had higher BW, BW gain and feed intake on d 7, 14 and 42 (P < 0.05), and higher BW, feed intake and feed conversion ratio at d 28 (P < 0.01). There were no treatment effects on drinking behavior, BW gain on d 28 and feed conversion ratio on d 42 (P > 0.05). There were few dose-related differences of the synbiotic on production performance; namely, the 1.0X concentration resulted in the highest BW and feed intake on d 14 and 42 (P < 0.05), while BW gain was higher compared to the control group only on d 42 (P < 0.05). The results suggest that the synbiotic supplement may prove to be an important management tool for the broiler industry to diminish the negative effects of HS, potentially safeguarding the welfare and production of broiler chickens, particularly in areas that experience hot climates.",

Heat stressed (HS) broilers were held at 32 ± 1°C from days 22 to 42 and fed the basal diet containing variable levels of betaine. Broilers were examined at days 28, 35 and 42 for body weight, feed consumption, fat deposition and serum lipids. The CONT and betaine-supplemented groups showed higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) feed consumption, body weight gain, and lower feed : gain ratio compared with the HS-CONT group. Meanwhile, heat stress increased abdominal, intermuscular and subcutaneous fat deposition, whereas the supplemental betaine significantly decreased those compared with the HS-CONT group. Additionally, betaine supplementation significantly decreased triglyceride, free fatty acids, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with HS-CONT. Chronic HS reduces broiler production performance. However, betaine can reverse these negative effects partially and thus improve carcass composition by changing lipid metabolism.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Alterations in ambient temperature have been associated with multiple detrimental effects on broilers such as intestinal barrier disruption and dysbiosis resulting in systemic inflammation. Inflammation and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>) have shown to play a negative and positive role, respectively, in the regulation of bone mass. Hence the potential of 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> in alleviating heat induced bone alterations and its mechanisms was studied. Heat stress (HS) directly induced a decrease in tibia material properties and bone mass, as demonstrated by lower mineral content, and HS caused a notable increase in intestinal permeability. Treatment with dietary 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> reversed the HS-induced bone loss and barrier leak. Broilers suffering from HS exhibited dysbiosis and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the ileum and bone marrow, as well as increased osteoclast number and activity. The changes were prevented by dietary 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> administration. Specifically, dietary 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> addition decreased abundance of B- and T-cells in blood, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α, in both the ileum and bone marrow, but did not alter the diversity and population or composition of major bacterial phyla. With regard to bone remodeling, dietary 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> supplementation was linked to a decrease in serum C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen reflecting bone resorption and a concomitant decrement in osteoclast-specific marker genes expression (e.g. cathepsin K), whereas it did not apparently change serum bone formation markers during HS. These data underscore the damage of HS to intestinal integrity and bone health, as well as that dietary 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub> supplementation was identified as a potential therapy for preventing these adverse effects.",

Our findings revealed that dietary ZnONPs altered the gene expression of cholecystokinin (ileum), heat stress proteins (HSP) 70 (jejunum and ileum), and HSP 90 (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). The gene expression of ghrelin was affected by the interaction between the ZnONPs concentration and temperature in the duodenum and stomach. More studies are required to elucidate its complex physiological and biochemical functions of the regulation of gene expression within the intestine in heat-stressed broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) is an environmental stressor challenging poultry production and requires a strategy to cope with it. A total of 288-day-old male broiler chicks were fed with one of the following diets: basal diet, basal with betaine (BET), or with selenium and vitamin E (AOX), or with a combination of BET and AOX, under thermoneutral and cyclic HS. Results showed that HS reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI) (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and average daily gain (ADG) (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and impaired feed conversion ratio (FCR) (<i>p</i> = 0.03) during rearing period (0⁻42 day). BET increased ADG (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and decreased FCR (<i>p</i> = 0.02), whereas AOX had no effects. Breast muscle weight was decreased by HS (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and increased by BET (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Rectal temperature was increased by HS (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and improved by BET overall. Respiration rate was increased by HS (<i>p</i> < 0.001), but BET decreased it during HS (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Jejunum transepithelial resistance was reduced by HS and had no effect on permeability whereas BET increased jejunum permeability (<i>p</i> = 0.013). Overall, the reductions in ADG of broiler chickens during HS were ameliorated by supplementation with BET, with much of the increase in ADG being breast muscle.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of compound organic acid calcium (COAC) on growth performance, hepatic antioxidant status and intestinal barrier of male broilers under high ambient temperature (32.7°C). Nine hundred healthy one-d-old Cobb-500 male broiler chicks were randomly assigned into three groups with six replicates of 50 birds each. A basal diet supplemented with 0% (control), 0.4% and 0.8% COAC, respectively were fed to birds for 6 weeks. All treatments were under high ambient indoor temperature of 32.7°C, and had a constant calcium and available phosphorus ratio. The results showed that, compared with control, the average daily gain of broilers in 0.4% and 0.8% was significantly increased and the ratio of feed to gain in in 0.4% and 0.8% was significantly decreased at 1 to 21, 22 to 42 and 1 to 42 days of age (p<0.05). Compared with control, 0.8% COAC slightly decreased (p = 0.093) the content of malondialdehyde in liver at 42 days of age while 0.4% COAC significantly decreased (p<0.05) the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, 0.4% COAC significantly enhanced the intestinal barrier function via increasing jejunal and ileal ocln transcription, promoting jejunal mucin 2 transcription at 42 days of age (p<0.05), and decreasing jejunal toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) and ileal TLR-15, inducible nitric oxide synthase compared with control group (p<0.05). Whereas, no significant differences on the transcription of interleukin-1β in jejunum and ileum were observed among three treatments (p>0.05). Overall, heat stress caused by high natural environment temperature may induce the damage to hepatic antioxidation and intestinal barrier. Dietary inclusion of COAC can improve the tolerance of broilers to thermal environment through the modification of antioxidative parameters in liver and the mRNA expression of genes in intestinal barrier, resulting in an optimal inclusion level of 0.4%.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary vitamin E (VE) on broiler meat quality, especially focused on PSE (pale color, soft and exudative), under chronic heat stress (HS) conditions. Twenty-eight-day-old female Ross broilers were kept in independent cages with a controlled temperature of 24°C (normal temperature: NT) or 30°C (high temperature: HT). The NT chickens were fed basal feed. The HT chickens were fed basal feed (HT) or VE (200 mg/kg) added feed (HT + E). Broilers were weighed and slaughtered at 38 days old. The breast muscle was removed immediately and then the samples were used for determination of meat color, pH, water holding capacity (WHC) and shear force value (SFV). Body weight gain and feed intake were significantly decreased in the HT and HT + E groups compared to the NT group. VE supplementation did not affect the growth performance. Chronic HS at 30°C for 10 days may cause deterioration of meat quality such as PSE. The effects of chronic HS on meat quality were most significant in the toughness of broiler breast meat. Supplementation of VE in broiler feed would be effective to prevent the extent of PSE on broiler meat by chronic HS.",

    "abstract": "In broiler chickens, the relationship between dietary supplementation of vitamin C and hepatic, cardiac and renal heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90), heat shock factors (HSF-1 and HSF-3) and enzymatic antioxidants requires further investigation. The current study aimed to investigate this relationship at cellular and molecular levels in a 42 days experiment. Two hundred, one-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were allocated into four equal groups. Chicks in the first and third groups were thermo-neutral (TN; 22°C for 24 hours/day) and fed basal diet without or with vitamin C (1g/kg basal diet), respectively. Chicks in the second and fourth groups were heat stressed (HS; 34°C for 8 hours/day) and fed basal diet without or with vitamin C, respectively. Performance parameters were recorded throughout the experiment. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), Catalase (CAT) and gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSP60, 70 and 90) and heat shock factors (HSF 1 and 3) were analyzed in liver, heart and kidney tissues of the studied groups. Heat stress induced a negative impact on performance parameters, significant reduction in activities of all examined antioxidant enzymes and a significant up-regulation in heat shock proteins and factors genes in all studied tissues. Dietary supplementation of vitamin C corrected these parameters towards the normal control values. Conclusively, dietary supplementation of the examined dose of vitamin C was efficient at ameliorating the detrimental effects of heat stress on liver, heart and kidney tissues of broilers chickens at cellular and molecular levels.",

    "abstract": "Organic sources of trace minerals (TM) in broiler diets are more bioavailable and stable than inorganic sources, making them particularly beneficial during challenging periods such as heat stress (HS) conditions. A 42-d study investigated the effects of using advanced chelate technology-based TM (ACTM) or adding varying amounts of ACTM to broiler diets during HS conditions. The study involved 672 male broiler chickens in 7 treatment groups, including a thermoneutral control (TNC) group and six HS treatments. There were 8 replicate pens per treatment and 12 birds per replicate. The six HS treatments included birds exposed to a cyclic HS environment (34°C) for 8 h and were as follows: HSC, which consisted of the same basal diet with the recommended ITM levels; ACTM50 and ACTM100, which replaced the basal diet with 50% and 100% ACTM instead of ITM; ITM+ACTM12.5 and ITM+ACTM25, which involved adding extra ACTM to the ITM basal diet at 12.5% and 25%, respectively; and ITM125, which used 125% of the recommended levels of ITM in the basal diet. Compared with the HSC treatment, the TNC, ACTM100, and ITM+ACTM25 treatments resulted in increased (P < 0.05) body weight; tibia weight; tibia ash, phosphorus, iron, and manganese contents; secondary antibody titers; and serum TAC and SOD values but decreased (P < 0.05) serum MDA concentrations and the expression levels of the hepatic genes IL-1β, IL-6, and INF-γ. The TNC and ACTM100 groups also showed greater (P < 0.05) feed efficiency, tibia length, tibia zinc content, and hepatic SOD1 expression but exhibited reduced (P < 0.05) hepatic NF-kB expression. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in primary anti-NDV titers, serum GPx1 activity, and Nrf2 and GPx1 gene expression levels were also detected in the ACTM100, ITM+ACTM12.5, and ITM+ACTM25 groups. In conclusion, the findings suggest that replacing ITM with ACTM or adding ACTM to ITM diets, especially at a 25% higher dose, can effectively protect broilers from heat stress by promoting growth, reducing inflammation, and increasing the expression of antioxidant proteins.",

For this aim, the effect of these supplements on the broilers' growth performance, some blood parameters, antioxidant, and immune status were evaluated. Hatchling Cobb-500 broilers (total = 240) were fed either corn and soybean meal-based diet (control group) or basal diet supplemented with 200 mg AA/kg diet, 1.5 mg FA/kg diet, or 200 mg AA plus 1.5 mg FA/kg diet, for 35 days during the summer months (n = 6 replicates/group, 10 birds/replicate). The minimum and maximum average temperatures ranged from 84.5 to 96.2 °F, and the relative humidity ranged from 68.5 to 76.5%. Supplemented vitamins either alone and (or) in combination increased (P < 0.01) broilers' growth performance, thyroid hormones levels, insulin growth factor1, blood hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, globulin, heat shock protein70, total antioxidant capacity, catalase enzyme activity, superoxide dismutase enzyme activity, antibody titer against Newcastle disease virus, and decreased (P < 0.01) heterophil/lymphocytes. The effects (P < 0.01) of the supplemented vitamins on the analyzed parameters were better when they were added in combination. In conclusion, the combination of AA and FA at 200 and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively, increased the broilers' antioxidant status with coordinated improvement in the growth performance and health status under HS.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) incidence is associated with the accumulation of reactive substances, which might be associated with bone loss. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) exhibits strong antioxidants due to its sulfhydryl group and being as the precursor for endogenous glutathione synthesis. Therefore, interplay between oxidative stress and bone turnover of broilers and the effects of dietary NAC inclusion on antioxidant capability and \"gut-bone\" axis were evaluated during chronic HS. Implementing cyclic chronic HS (34 °C for 7 h/d) evoked reactive oxygen species excessive production and oxidant stress, which was accompanied by compromised tibia mass. The RNA-seq of proximal tibia also revealed the enrichment of oxidation-reduction process and inflammatory outbursts during HS. Although no notable alterations in the growth performance and cecal microbiota were found, the diet contained 2 g/kg NAC enhanced the antioxidant capability of heat-stressed broiler chickens by upregulating the expression of Nrf2 in the ileum, tibia, and bone marrow. Simultaneously, NAC tended to hinder NF-κB pathway activation and decreased the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines in both the ileum and bone marrow. As a result, NAC suppressed osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, thereby increasing osteocyte-related gene expression. Furthermore, the inclusion of NAC tended to increase the ash content and density of the whole tibia, as well as improve cortical thickness and bone volume of the diaphysis. These findings HS-mediated outburst of oxidant stress accelerates bone resorption and negatively regulates the bone quality of tibia, which is inhibited by NAC in broilers.",

Ninety 23-day-old chickens were randomly allocated into seven groups: (1) control, (2) short-term CHS (5 days), (3) short-term CHS + vitamin C (12 g/100 l drinking water of a 50% product), (4) medium-term CHS (10 days), (5) medium-term CHS + vitamin C, (6) long-term CHS (20 days) and (7) long-term CHS + vitamin C. In heat-stressed groups the temperature was increased to 39 ± 1°C for 8 h/day. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and shank, keel and tibia bones were removed. CHS was not associated with a drastic change in serum Ca and corticosterone, or bone characteristics (both cortical and trabecular bones in radiographical and histological evaluation), or birds' performance. Oxidative stress was present especially with short-term CHS. CHS, especially for short or medium periods, showed a tendency to increase serum vitamin C and administration of this vitamin did not make a significant change in its serum levels although it ameliorated oxidative stress. In conclusion, it seems that CHS is not associated with an appreciable change in broiler performance, bone characteristics, or selected serum parameters; and simultaneous vitamin C administration at the dosage of 12 g/100 l in drinking water has no beneficial effect apart from reducing oxidative stress especially in short-term chronically heat-stressed birds.",

Plasma corticosterone, heat shock protein70 (HSP70) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were not affected by dietary treatments. Postbiotics decreased plasma cholesterol concentration compared to other groups, and plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) compared to the NC group. Postbiotics increased breast meat pH, and decreased shear force and lightness (L*) compared to NC and PC groups. The drip loss, cooking loss and yellowness (b*) were lower in postbiotics groups compared to other groups.

The experimental design was 3 × 3 factorial, in which three levels (0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 ppm) and three sources (inorganic, green nano, and market nano) of Se resulted in nine treatments viz. IS-0.15, GNS-0.15, MNS-0.15, IZ-0.20, GNS-0.20, MNS-0.20, IS-0.25, GNS-0.25, and MNS-0.25 (IS: inorganic Se, GNS: green nano Se, MNS: market nano Se). A total of 432 broiler chicken were divided among nine treatments with six replicates of birds per treatment (8 birds/replicate). Results of present study revealed significantly better growth performance of birds supplemented with 0.25 ppm nano Se. The supplementation of 0.25 ppm nano Se improved the immune response and lymphoid organ development of birds. Significantly higher Se and nitrogen digestibility coefficients, serum antioxidant activity and decline of Heterophil: Lymphocyte ratio and expression of HSP70 gene were observed in birds supplemented with 0.25 ppm Se and nano source of Se compared to inorganic Se. Significantly higher Se concentration in liver and breast muscle and higher serum Se concentration were observed in birds fed 0.25 ppm nano Se. The liver Se concentration was much higher than that of breast muscle. However, the nano Se synthesized by green method in this study did not differ significantly from the chemically synthesized nano Se. It was concluded that 0.25 ppm Se and nano form of Se are superior to lower levels and inorganic form of Se, respectively, in improving the immunity, growth, antioxidant status, and in stress alleviation of broiler chicken. However, GNS is equally efficient as chemically synthesized MNS.",

To investigate the alleviative effects and molecular mechanisms of taurine supplementation on breast meat quality in broilers exposed to chronic heat stress, 144 28-day-old chickens (Arbor Acres) were randomly distributed to thermoneutral (TN, 22 °C, basal diet), heat stress (HS, consistent 32 °C, basal diet), or heat stress plus taurine (HS + T, consistent 32 °C, basal diet + 5.00 g kg<sup>-1</sup> taurine) groups for a 14-day trial. Chronic heat stress did not affect the contents of moisture, crude protein and crude fat in breast muscle, but impaired breast meat quality in broilers. Taurine supplementation significantly alleviated the increase in lightness and drip loss and the decrease in pH<sub>45 min</sub> and shear force of breast meat in chronic heat-stressed broilers. Compared with the HS group, taurine supplementation significantly decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde and increased the messenger RNA expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and heme oxygenase 1 in the HS + T group. Meanwhile, taurine supplementation effectively alleviated mitochondrial damage caused by chronic heat exposure.

    "title": "Effect of Supplementing Organic Forms of Zinc, Selenium and Chromium on Performance, Anti-Oxidant and Immune Responses in Broiler Chicken Reared in Tropical Summer.",
    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to study the effect of supplementing organic forms of zinc (Zn), selenium (Se) and chromium (Cr) on performance, anti-oxidant activities and immune responses in broiler chickens from 1 to 21 days of age, which were reared in cyclic heat-stressed condition under tropical summer in open-sided poultry house. A total of 200 (experiment I) and 450-day-old (experiment II) broiler male chicks (Cobb 400) were randomly distributed in stainless steel battery brooders (610 mm × 762 mm × 475 mm) at the rate of five birds per pen. A maize-soybean meal-based control diet (CD) containing recommended (Vencobb 400, Broiler Management Guide) concentrations of inorganic trace minerals and other nutrients was prepared. The CD was supplemented individually with organic form of selenium (Se, 0.30 mg/kg), chromium (Cr, 2 mg/kg) and zinc (Zn, 40 mg/kg) in experiment I. In experiment II, two concentrations of each Zn (20 and 40 mg/kg), Se (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) and Cr (1 and 2 mg/kg) were supplemented to the basal diet in 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design. A group without supplementing inorganic trace minerals was maintained as control group in both experiments. Each diet was allotted randomly to ten replicates in both experiments and fed ad libitum from 1 to 21 days of age. At 19th day of age, blood samples were collected for estimation of anti-oxidant and immune responses. Supplementation of Se, Cr and Zn increased (P < 0.05) body mass gain (BMG) and feed intake compared to those fed the CD in experiment I. The feed efficiency (FE) in Cr-fed group was higher (P < 0.05) compared to the CD-fed group. Se or Cr supplementation reduced lipid peroxidation (LP) compared to broilers fed the CD. In experiment II, BMG was not affected (P > 0.05) by the interaction between levels of Zn, Se and Cr in broiler diet. The FE improved (P < 0.05) with supplementation of the trace minerals tested at both concentrations except in group fed 40 mg Zn, 0.5 mg Se and 1 mg Cr/kg. Reduction in lipid peroxidation (LP, P < 0.05) and increased (P < 0.05) activity of superoxide dismutase were observed in broiler fed organic Zn, Se and Cr compared to the CD-fed group. The dietary concentrations of Zn, Se and Cr did not influence (P > 0.05) the immune responses (Newcastle disease titre and cell-mediated immune response to phytohaemagglutinin-P) in both the experiments. Based on the results, it is concluded that supplementation of organic form of Se, Cr and Zn (0.30, 2 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) either alone or in combination significantly improved performance and anti-oxidant responses (reduced LP and increased superoxide dismutase) in commercial broiler chicks (21 days of age) reared in cyclic heat stress conditions in open-sided poultry house during summer.",

    "title": "Metabolic characteristics and oxidative damage to skeletal muscle in broiler chickens exposed to chronic heat stress.",
    "year": "2009",
    "abstract": "Emerging evidence has shown that acute heat exposure affects metabolic characteristics and causes oxidative damage to skeletal muscle in birds. Little is known, however, about such phenomena under chronic heat stress conditions. To address this, we designed the present study to determine the influence of cyclic (32 to 24 to 32 degrees C: 32 degrees C for 8 h/d, 32-24-32HS ), and constant (32 and 34 degrees C, 32HS and 34HS, respectively) heat exposure on the metabolic and peroxide status in skeletal muscle of 4-wk-old male broiler chickens. Heat stress, particularly in the 32HS and 34HS groups, depressed feed intake and growth, while cyclic high temperature gave rise to a less severe stress response in performance terms. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in skeletal muscle were enhanced (P<0.05) by constant heat treatment; the degree of enhancement was not as large as the changes observed in our previous 'acute' heat stress model. The 3HADH (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase related to fatty acid oxidation) and CS (citrate synthase) enzyme activities were lowered (P<0.05) by both the cyclic and constant 34HS treatments, and constant 34HS group, respectively. These results suggest that chronic heat exposure decreases metabolic oxidation capacity in skeletal muscle of broiler chickens. On exposure to chronic heat stress, GPx activity remained relatively constant, though a temperature-dependent elevation in Cu/Zn-SOD activity was observed, implying that anti-oxidation ability was disturbed by the chronic stress condition. From these results it can be concluded that chronic heat stress did not induce oxidative damage to a major extent. This may probably be due to a decrease in metabolic oxidation capacity or due to a self-propagating scavenging system, though the system was not fully activated.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of chlorogenic acid-enriched extract (CGAE) from Eucommia ulmoides leaf on performance, meat quality, oxidative stability, and fatty acid profile of breast meat in heat-stressed broilers, 400 28-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 10 replicates per group (10 broilers per replicate). Broilers in the normal group (NOR) were kept at 22 ± 2°C (24 h/D) and fed the basal diet, and the other 3 groups were treated with cyclic heat (34 ± 2°C from 08:00 to 18:00 and 22 ± 2°C from 18:00 to 08:00) and fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 (HT), 500 (CGAE500), and 1,000 mg (CGAE1000) mg of CGAE/kg of diet. The experiment lasted for 14 D. Compared with the HT group, broilers in the NOR and CGAE1000 groups had a higher average daily gain and a lower feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05). CGAE supplementation at 1,000 mg/kg increased pH24 value, a* value and total superoxide dismutase activity and reduced drip loss, cooking loss, L* value and the contents of malondialdehyde and carbonyl in breast meat of heat-stressed broilers (P < 0.05). Broilers in the HT group showed lower mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (P < 0.001), superoxide dismutase (P = 0.004), and catalase (P < 0.001) in breast meat compared with the other groups. CGAE supplementation at 1,000 mg/kg reduced the stearic acid and saturated fatty acids (SFA) contents and increased the dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and n-6 PUFA contents and PUFA:SFA ratio in breast meat of heat-stressed broilers (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CGAE supplementation at 1,000 mg/kg could alleviate the adverse effects of heat stress on growth performance and meat quality and improve oxidative stability and fatty acid profile of breast meat in heat-stressed broilers.",

    "abstract": "Broilers raised in tropical environments face significant oxidative stress due to heat, which can impair performance. Vitamin E and selenium (Se) are key nutrients supporting antioxidant defenses and are commonly supplemented in feed. This study evaluated the effects of two selenium sources-sodium selenite (SS) and hydroxy‑selenomethionine (OH-SeMet)-combined with standard or reduced vitamin E levels on broiler performance. A total of 800 male broilers were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Results demonstrated that OH-SeMet improved growth and feed efficiency compared to SS, regardless of vitamin E level, while reduced vitamin E impaired early growth but not overall performance. The combination of OH-SeMet with standard vitamin E provided the best feed conversion ratio at 44 days. These findings highlight the benefits of using OH-SeMet with adequate vitamin E supplementation to enhance broiler resilience to heat stress, offering a practical strategy for improving production efficiency in tropical commercial operations.",

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "High temperature is one of the prominent environmental factors causing economic losses to the poultry industry as it negatively affects growth and production performance in broiler chickens. We used One Step TaqMan real time RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) technology to study the effects of chronic heat stress on the expression of genes codifying for the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), as well as for heat shock protein (HSP) 70, HSP90, glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), and caspase 6 (CASP6) in the liver of two different broiler genetic strains: Red JA Cou Nu Hubbard (CN) and Ross 508 Aviagen (RO). CN is a naked neck slow growing broiler intended for the free range and/or organic markets, whereas RO is selected for fast growing. We also analysed the effect of chronic heat stress on productive performances, and plasma corticosterone levels as well as the association between transcriptomic response and specific SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in each genetic strain of broiler chickens. RO and CN broilers, 4 weeks of age, were maintained for 4 weeks at either 34 °C or 22 °C. The results demonstrated that there was a genotype and a temperature main effect on the broilers' growth from the 4th to the 8th week of age, but the interaction effect between genotype and temperature resulted not statistically significant. By considering the genotype effect, fast growing broilers (RO) grew more than the slow growing ones (CN), whereas by considering the temperature effect, broilers in unheated conditions grew more than the heat stressed ones. Corticosterone levels increased significantly in the blood of heat stressed broilers, due to the activation of the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis). Carcass yield at slaughter was of similar values in the 4 cohorts (genotype/temperature combinations or treatment groups), ranging from 86.5 to 88.6%, whereas carcass weight was negatively influenced by heat stress in both broiler strains. Heat stress affected gene expression by downregulating CASP6 and upregulating CAT transcript levels. HSPs, SOD and NR3C1 mRNA levels remained unaffected by heat stress. The differences found in the mRNA copies of CASP6 gene could be partly explained by SNPs.",

    "abstract": "The study investigated the impact of Mistletoe Leaf Powder (MLP) supplementation on some parameters in heat-stressed broiler chickens. The standard baseline diets, comprising four different formulations, were provided during the starter and finisher stages. Chickens were randomly assigned to the 4 dietary groups: a negative control (CON) with no supplementation, a positive control (VTC) with 200 mg/kg vitamin C, and 2 experimental treatment groups with 2500 mg/kg (MLP2) and 5000 mg/kg (MLP5) MLP supplementation. The Body Weight Gain (BWG) in MLP2 and MLP5 treatment groups was comparable (P > 0.05) to those in VTC, while the CON group exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower BWG. Feed consumption was significantly (P < 0.05) lower broiler chickens in the CON group compared to those VTC, MLP2, and MLP5. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) levels were lower in broiler chickens belonging to VTC, MLP2, and MLP5 groups compared to those in CON, and MLP2 showed no difference (P > 0.05) from MLP5 and VTC. Serum glutathione peroxidase and catalase concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in birds belonging to MLP5, MLP2, and VTC groups compared to CON. The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine concentration was lower (P < 0.05) in birds of VTC, MLP2, and MLP5 compared to the CON, with VTC showing the least concentration. Serum insulin levels were higher (P < 0.05) in MLP5 compared to those in CON, while serum triiodothyronine and leptin concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in CON compared to birds in VTC, MLP2, and MLP5. Microbiota analysis revealed that the Coliform bacteria population was higher (P < 0.05) in birds belonging to CON compared to those in VTC, MLP2, and MLP5 groups, whereas lactic acid-producing bacteria were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in birds of CON and highest in MLP2 and MLP5 groups.

    "abstract": "This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin E, selenium (Se), and a combination of the two, on the performance, serum metabolites and oxidative stability of skeletal muscle of broilers during heat stress. The broilers raised in either a thermoneutral (23.9°C constant) or heat stress (23.9°C to 37°C cycling) environment were assigned to 6 dietary treatments (0, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg Se; 125 and 250 mg/kg vitamin E; or 0.5 mg/kg Se plus 125 mg/kg vitamin E) from 1 to 49 days of age. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected from chicks, the chicks sacrificed, and pectoralis superficialis muscle was used for measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The heat-stressed chicks consumed less feed, gained less weight, and had higher feed conversion ratio when compared to thermoneutral chicks (P<0.05). Serum concentrations of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) were decreased by heat stress (P<0.05), whereas the serum concentrations of copper (Cu), glucose, and uric acid were significantly increased under heat stress (P<0.05). The chicks that received supplemental of vitamin E exhibited significantly higher serum concentrations of Zn (P<0.05) and significantly lower concentrations of Cu, glucose, and uric acid (P<0.05) when exposed to heat stress. Dietary Se also caused a significant decrease in serum glucose, uric acid, and Cu concentrations of heat-stressed broilers (P<0.05), but had no significant effect on Zn concentration (P>0.05). The GPx activity remained relatively constant (P>0.05), though SOD activity and MDA levels in skeletal muscle were enhanced on exposure to heat stress (P<0.05). The heat-stressed chicks that received the combined supplementary level of vitamin E and Se had the lowest concentration of MDA and the highest activity of SOD in the skeletal muscle (P<0.05). Dietary Se also caused a significant increase in enzyme activity of GPx in the skeletal muscle (P<0.05). These results indicate that the derangement of blood parameters and oxidative stability in broilers under heat stress are improved by supplemental vitamin E and Se.",

The 3 experimental treatments (i.e., control, 0.3 and 0.6% KCl) were allocated to 3 replicates of 15 birds each. The control group was kept on dugout tap water, whereas the other 2 groups were supplied water supplemented with 0.3 and 0.6% KCl (wt/vol) by supplementing 3 and 6 g of KCl, respectively, per liter of drinking water. Broilers were provided ad libitum access to feed and water for the experimental period of 7 to 42 d of age and kept in open-sided house. The birds were reared under continuous thermostress (minimum 28.2 +/- 1.02 and maximum 37.5 +/- 0.78 degrees C) environment. Supplementing drinking water with 0.6% KCl reduced panting-phase blood pH to 7.31 and significantly increased live BW gain by 14.5 (P = 0.036) and 7.9% (P = 0.029) at 28 and 42 d of age, respectively, relative to control. An improved (P = 0.04) feed:gain and lowered body temperature were noted in groups supplemented with 0.6% KCl as compared with control and 0.3% KCl. Enhanced physiological adaptation with 0.6% KCl was evidenced by a more favorable pH during the panting phase in the present study. These findings demonstrated a possibility of better broiler live performance through KCl supplementation under conditions of severe heat stress (35 to 38 degrees C).",

Birds were raised in either a thermoneutral (TN, 23.9 degrees C constant) or heat stress conditions (HS, 23.9 degrees C to 38 degrees C cycling) and were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet supplemented with Se at 0, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg.

Body weight and feed intake were not influenced by dietary Se, while feed conversion was significantly improved by a Se-supplementation of 0.2 mg/kg. HS significantly reduced body weight, feed intake and feed conversion. Numbers of abdominal exudate cells (AEC), percentage of macrophages in AEC, phagocytic macrophages, internalized opsonised and unopsonised sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were significantly increased by dietary Se. Both primary and secondary antibody responses were characterised by increasing titres of antibody to SRBC by dietary Se when birds were exposed to HS (p < 0.05). Lymphoid organ weights, antibody responses, incidence of macrophages in AEC, and phagocytic ability of macrophages were also significantly reduced under HS. These results indicated that HS severely reduced growth performance and immunocompetence of broilers, whereas the immune response of broilers improved by dietary Se supplementation under HS.",

    "abstract": "A study with a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement was conducted to investigate the effects of 4 dietary protein levels and 2 environmental conditions on acute phase proteins (APP), brain heat shock protein (HSP) 70 density, and growth performance of broiler chickens. Day-old broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were fed isocaloric diets but with various levels of crude protein (CP), namely, (1) 21.0 and 19.0% CP in starter and finisher diets, respectively (control), (2) 19.5 and 17.5% CP in starter and finisher diets, respectively (Diet A), (3) 18.0 and 16.0% CP in starter and finisher diets, respectively (Diet B), and (4) 16.5 and 14.5% CP in starter and finisher diets, respectively (Diet C). Equal numbers of birds from each diet were subjected to either 23±1°C throughout or 33±1°C for 6 h per d from 22 to 35 d of age. From d 1 to 21, feed intake (FI) and weight gain (WG) decreased linearly (P = 0.021 and P = 0.009, respectively), as CP level was reduced. During the heat treatment period (d 22 to 35), there were significant (P = 0.04) diet × heat treatment interactions for FCR. Diet had no effect on FCR among the unheated birds, but the ratio increased linearly (P = 0.007) as dietary CP level decreased. Irrespective of ambient temperature, there was a significant linear decrease in FI (P = 0.032) and WG (P < 0.001) as dietary CP level decreased. Low-CP diets improved the survivability of heat-stressed broilers when compared to those fed control diets. Low-CP diets linearly decreased (P < 0.01) APP (ovotransferrin and alpha-acid glycoprotein) responses. Both APP and HSP 70 reactions were elevated following heat treatment. In conclusion, feeding broilers with low-CP diets adversely affect the growth performance of broilers under heat stress condition. However, low-CP diets were beneficial in improving the survivability. Because APP are involved in the restoration of homeostasis, the adverse effect of low-CP diet on the synthesis of these proteins could be of concern.",

To explore new sources of tannin-rich extracts, which have potential benefits for animal health, this study focused on the effects of polyphenolic extracts from involucres of Castanea mollissima Blume (PICB) on heat-stressed broilers. In vitro experiments were first performed using intestinal cryptlike epithelial cell line-6 (IEC-6) cells to evaluate the effects of PICB on cell proliferation and antioxidative parameters under normal and heat-stress conditions. Then in vivo experiments were carried out with 2 trials: in trial 1, 400 one-d-old male Arbor Acres (AA) broilers were randomly assigned to 5 groups (4 replicates/group, 20 chicks/replicate): group 1 was a normal control group fed the basic ration; groups 2 to 5 were fed the basic ration supplemented with 0.2% vitamin C and 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4% PICB, respectively. Trial 1 lasted 42 d, and growth performance was monitored every week. At the end of the trial, the chicks were sacrificed and sampled. In trial 2, 400 twenty-eight-d-old chicks were randomly assigned to 5 groups as described in trial 1. After 1 week of adaptation, heat stress was applied for 7 consecutive days. On days 3 and 7 of heat stress, the chicks were sacrificed and sampled. The results showed that PICB could stimulate IEC-6 cell proliferation and had strong in vitro antioxidant activity. PICB had no effect on the growth performance and carcass parameters of AA broilers in trial 1, whereas in trial 2, group 4 saw improved growth performance and antioxidant activity compared to the first three groups (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PICB had no effects on the growth performance of IEC-6 cells and AA broilers under normal conditions, whereas it could mitigate heat-stress effects on the growth performance and antioxidant activity of IEC-6 cells and AA broilers, implying that PICB could be used as a suitable additive to improve animal production under heat-stress conditions.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) induces oxidative stress in the liver and affects health and production attributes in poultry birds. Bamboo leaf flavonoid (BLF) is a natural plant flavonoid that is effective in controlling oxidative stress. Therefore, the aim of current study was to investigate the impact of BLF on growth performance, liver index, serum biochemical parameters of liver function, liver antioxidant enzyme activities, and expression of genes and proteins related to the liver Keap1-Nrf2 system in cyclic heat stress (CHS) broilers. Twenty-eight-day old Arbor Acres broilers (n = 200) were randomly assigned to 5 groups. TN group fed basal diet was reared in a thermoneutral environment (24 ± 1 °C); CHS, 400 mg/kg BLF + CHS, 800 mg/kg BLF + CHS, and 1600 mg/kg BLF + CHS groups were reared in high temperature conditions (33 ± 1 °C, 8 h/day), with the basal diet supplemented with 0, 400, 800, and 1600 mg/kg BLF. The results indicated that ADG and ADFI of broilers in 28 to 35d and 36 to 42d CHS groups were significantly lower compared to the TN group. BLF improves growth performance of CHS broilers by increasing ADG, ADFI and decreasing F:G. BLF improved live weight, liver weight, liver index and reduced serum AST, ALP, ALT, T-BIL levels and increased TP levels in CHS broilers. Meanwhile, BLF supplementation enhanced the activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, resulting in higher T-AOC, CAT, GSH-PX and T-SOD levels than those of CHS broilers, and significantly reduced MDA levels. In addition, BLF down-regulated the protein levels of Keap1 and P62, increased the expression levels of Nrf2 genes and proteins, and activated the expression of its downstream NQO1, HO-1, and SOD-1 antioxidant genes compared to CHS broilers. In summary, BLF regulates the expression of key genes and proteins in the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway to alleviate liver injury in broilers by inhibiting oxidative stress, thereby promoting the growth performance of broilers with CHS.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary curcumin supplementation on the performance, mitochondrial redox system, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, and antioxidant-related gene expression in the liver of broiler chickens after heat stress treatment. At day 21, a total of 400 Arbor Acres broiler chickens with similar body weight (BW) were divided into 5 groups with 8 replicates per group and then reared either at a normal temperature (22 ± 1 °C) or at a high ambient temperature (34 ± 1 °C for 8 h and 22 ± 1 °C for the remaining time) for 20 d. Broilers in the 5 groups were fed a basal diet at a normal temperature (NT group) and a basal diet with 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg curcumin at a high ambient temperature (HT, CUR50, CUR100, and CUR200 groups), respectively. The serum and liver samples were analyzed for the parameters related to hepatic damage, mitochondrial function, and redox status. The results showed that the G:F was increased in the CUR50 and CUR100 groups, and the final BW was increased in CUR100 group in comparison with the HT group (P < 0.05). When compared with those in the HT group, both serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities were decreased in the curcumin-supplemented groups (P < 0.05). Curcumin decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production but increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in the hepatocytes of the broilers after heat stress (P < 0.05). The broilers in curcumin-supplemented groups had lower malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl concentrations as well as greater thiol concentrations (P < 0.05). The mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity in the liver was increased (P < 0.05) in the CUR100 group compared with the HT group. Compared with the heat-stressed broilers, the broilers that were fed curcumin had greater (P < 0.05) mtDNA copy number and ATP concentrations than those in the HT group. Curcumin supplementation attenuated the depression of the thioredoxin 2 and peroxiredoxin-3 gene expressions (P < 0.05). The MnSOD gene expression was increased in the CUR100 and CUR200 groups, and the thioredoxin reductase 2 gene expression was increased in the CUR50 group in comparison with the HT group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, curcumin mitigated the mitochondrial dysfunction in heat-stressed broilers, as evidenced by the suppression of the ROS burst, the maintenance of the thiol pool and mtDNA content, and the enhanced mitochondrial antioxidant gene expression.",

    "year": "2015",
    "abstract": "Acute heat stress severely impacts poultry production. The hypothalamus acts as a crucial center to regulate body temperature, detect temperature changes, and modulate the autonomic nervous system and endocrine loop for heat retention and dissipation. The purpose of this study was to investigate global gene expression in the hypothalamus of broiler-type B strain Taiwan country chickens after acute heat stress. Twelve 30-week-old hens were allocated to four groups. Three heat-stressed groups were subjected to acute heat stress at 38 °C for 2 hours without recovery (H2R0), with 2 hours of recovery (H2R2), and with 6 hours of recovery (H2R6). The control hens were maintained at 25 °C. At the end, hypothalamus samples were collected for gene expression analysis. The results showed that 24, 11, and 25 genes were upregulated and 41, 15, and 42 genes were downregulated in H2R0, H2R2, and H2R6 treatments, respectively. The expressions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1), heat shock 27-kDa protein 1 (HSPB1), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) were upregulated at all recovery times after heat exposure. Conversely, the expression of TPH2 was downregulated at all recovery times. A gene ontology analysis showed that most of the differentially expressed genes were involved in biological processes including cellular processes, metabolic processes, localization, multicellular organismal processes, developmental processes, and biological regulation. A functional annotation analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were related to the gene networks of responses to stress and reproductive functions. These differentially expressed genes might be essential and unique key factors in the heat stress response of the hypothalamus in chickens.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary enzymatically treated Artemisia annua L. (EA) supplementation on meat quality, antioxidant capacity, and energy status of breast muscle in heat-stressed broilers. The inclusion of EA increased the redness, reduced drip loss, decreased reactive oxygen metabolites and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, increased antioxidant enzyme activities, and reduced the ferric reducing antioxidant power and free-radical scavenging abilities of breast muscle in heat-treated broilers. Dietary EA supplementation increased adenosine phosphate concentrations and energy charge, and decreased the mRNA expression levels of heat-shock protein 70 and 90, but increased the mRNA expression levels of avian uncoupling protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, and sirtuin 1 in the breast muscle of broilers exposed to HS. Dietary EA supplementation improved meat quality, antioxidant capacity, and energy status in breast muscle of heat-stressed broilers, which might be associated with altering pertinent mRNA expression; EA could therefore be used as a promising feed additive to mitigate HS in the poultry industry.

The birds (n = 150; 10-d-old) kept at 34 degrees C were fed a basal diet (HS group) or the basal diet supplemented with 250 mg of L-ascorbic acid/kg of diet (Vit C group), 1 mg of folic acid/kg of diet (FA group) or both (Vit C + FA group), whereas birds kept at 22 degrees C were fed the basal diet (TN group). Supplementing heat-stressed quail with vitamin C and folic acid improved performance compared to the HS group. Effects generally were greatest in quail supplemented with both. Although supplementation did not consistently restore concentrations to those of the TN group, it increased serum concentrations of the vitamins under study. Furthermore, serum and tissue MDA, homocysteine and ACTH concentrations were lower in the supplemented groups than in the heat-stressed controls. Retention of N, ash, Ca, P, Zn, Fe, Cu and Cr were highest in the Vit C + FA group and lowest in the HS group (P < 0.05). The results of the study indicate that vitamin C and folic acid supplementation attenuates the decline in performance and antioxidant status caused by heat stress. Such supplementation may offer protection against heat stress-related depression in performance of Japanese quail.",

A total of 360 22-day-old Arbor Acres male chickens were randomly assigned to five treatment groups under thermoneutral chamber (PC, 23 °C) and cyclic heat stress (HS, 30-34 °C cycling) conditions. Compared with the PC group, cyclic HS decreased (P < 0.05) daily weight gain (DWG), daily feed consumption (DFC), the concentrations of Gln, glutamate (Glu), and GABA, and the activities of glutaminase and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in breast muscle at 28, 35, and 42 days, while it increased (P < 0.05) the activities of glutamine synthetase (GS) and gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) at 28, 35, and 42 days. Dietary Gln and GABA improved (P < 0.05) DWG and DFC of broilers under cyclic HS during 28-42 days.

    "year": "2020",
    "abstract": "Thermal stress is a major source of oxidative damage in the broiler chicken (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) due to the latter's impaired metabolic function. While heat stress has been extensively studied in broilers, the effects of cold stress on broiler physiologic and oxidative function are still relatively unknown. The present study aimed to understand how thermal manipulation (TM) might affect a broiler's oxidative response to post-hatch thermal stress in terms of the mRNA expression of the catalase, NADPH oxidase 4 (<i>NOX4</i>), and superoxide dismutase 2 (<i>SOD2</i>) genes. During embryonic days 10 to 18, TM was carried out by raising the temperature to 39 °C at 65% relative humidity for 18 h/day. To induce heat stress, room temperature was raised from 21 to 35 °C during post-hatch days (PD) 28 to 35, while cold stress was induced during PD 32 to 37 by lowering the room temperature from 21 to 16 °C. At the end of the thermal stress periods, a number of chickens were euthanized to extract hepatic and splenic tissue from the heat-stressed group and cardiac, hepatic, muscular, and splenic tissue from the cold-stressed group. Catalase, <i>NOX4</i>, and <i>SOD2</i> expression in the heart, liver, and spleen were decreased in TM chickens compared to controls after both cold and heat stress. In contrast, the expression levels of these genes in the breast muscles of the TM group were increased or not affected. Moreover, TM chicks possessed an increased body weight (BW) and decreased cloacal temperature (T<sup>C</sup>) compared to controls on PD 37. In addition, TM led to increased BW and lower T<sup>C</sup> after both cold and heat stress. Conclusively, our findings suggest that TM has a significant effect on the oxidative function of thermally stressed broilers.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of water-supplemented PROs on growth performance, physiological responses, intestinal morphology, and inflammatory biomarkers in broiler chickens under thermo-neutral (TN) and HS conditions. A total of 192 one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly allocated to four treatment groups (6 replicates/group): TN with control (CON) water, TN with PRO-supplemented water, HS with CON water, and HS with PRO-supplemented water. PROs (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Bacillus pumilus</i>) were administered in drinking water at 50 mg/L from day 1 to 35. Birds in the HS groups were subjected to 3 h daily heat exposure (33°C ± 2°C) from days 31 to 35. Growth performance, physiological indicators, intestinal histomorphology, and blood biomarkers were assessed. HS significantly increased rectal temperature (Tr) (1.6°C; p < 0.01) and respiratory rate (57 breaths/min; p < 0.01). PRO supplementation reduced Tr by 0.17°C (p = 0.01) but did not affect performance metrics (feed intake, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio). HS reduced villus height (VH) and surface area in the jejunum and ileum (p < 0.05), while PROs partially ameliorated VH under HS. No significant effects of PROs were observed on serum amyloid A or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. However, PROs tended to reduce diamine oxidase levels (24%; p = 0.09). HS also decreased albumin and glucose levels (p ≤ 0.02). HS adversely affected intestinal integrity and selected blood metabolites. Although PRO supplementation had limited effects on performance and inflammatory biomarkers, it conferred modest thermoregulatory benefits and tended to improve intestinal permeability. Further research is warranted to optimize PRO formulation and assess synergistic strategies for HS mitigation in poultry.",

However, fortification of low-CP diet with individual NEAA failed to improve body weight (BW) (P < 0.0001), feed intake (FI) (P = 0.0001), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P = 0.0001). Serum uric acid (UA) was lower (P = 0.0356) in NC birds and NC diet supplemented with individual NEAA birds, whereas serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.007) and relative weight of abdominal fat (P = 0.001) were higher in these birds. In conclusion, no single NEAA fortification may compensate the depressed growth performance attributed to a low-CP diet. However, fortification with Gly may improve FCR. There is a possibility that broilers raised under the hot and humid climate require higher Gly fortification than the level used in this study.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "This study was aim to investigate the effects of lipoic acid (ALA) on performance, meat quality, serum biochemistry and antioxidant function of broilers under heat stress (HS). Two hundred1-day-old Cobb broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups and each treatment consisted of 4 replicates of 10 broilers each. The treatment group adopts a 2 × 2 two-factor setting, which is divided into two diets (basic diet or 250 mg/kg ALA diet) and two temperatures (24 ± 1℃ or 33 ± 1℃). Starting from the 28th day of age, broilers are kept at room temperature (24 ± 1℃) or exposed to cyclic HS (33 ± 1℃ from 8:00 am to 18:00, 24 ± 1℃ from 18:00 to 8:00 am). HS significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), direct bilirubin (D-BIL), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD). However, HS increased breast meat pH, serum uric acid (UA), total cholesterol (TC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Dietary ALA significantly decreased leg meat shear force and water loss rate, serum total bilirubin(T-BIL), UA, triglyceride (TG) and MDA of broilers. However, it increased daily gain (ADG), serum D-BIL and T-SOD. There is a significant interaction between temperature and additives. HS can destroy the balance of the oxidation-antioxidant system, and lead to damage to liver and kidney function and confusion energy metabolism. Dietary ALA improves the antioxidant capacity of broilers, reduces the level of blood lipids and liver and kidney metabolism, and increases the daily gain of heat-stressed broilers.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress in poultry is a serious problem in many countries and has been associated with oxidative stress. Hence, nutritional interventions with antioxidants might be beneficial. Therefore, the effects of dietary Curcuma xanthorrhiza (CX) and Origanum compactum (OC) essential oils on mRNA levels of heat shock protein 70 and antioxidant enzymes, oxidative status, and meat oxidative stability of heat-challenged broilers were studied. Starting on d 25 of age, a control diet and 4 diets containing 200 or 400 mg/kg feed of CX or OC (CX200, CX400, OC200, OC400 diets) were fed to 3 pen replicates of 20 Ross 308 chickens each. From d 28 of age on, the temperature was increased from 22 to 34°C with 50% RH for 5 h daily during 2 wk. Dietary CX or OC did not affect zootechnical performance. Feeding CX400 and both levels of OC increased the a* value in stored breast meat (P < 0.05), and OC diets tended to decrease the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values in fresh breast meat (P = 0.061). Compared with control, at d 31, feeding CX400 and OC400 reduced mRNA levels of heat shock protein 70 and increased mRNA levels of catalase in kidney and liver (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of superoxide dismutase were increased at d 31 on the OC400 diet in kidney and on the CX400 diet in heart (P < 0.05). In heart, at d 31, both dietary levels of CX and OC200 resulted in higher glutathione peroxidase activity (P < 0.05). Feeding CX400 increased superoxide dismutase activity in liver, kidney, and heart at d 31 (P < 0.05). Catalase activity was increased in the CX200 and OC400 groups at d 42 (P < 0.05). Feeding CX at both levels and OC200 decreased plasma malondialdehyde concentrations at d 42 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary essential oils rich in simple phenolic compounds offer potential for improving the antioxidant defense against heat stress-induced changes.",

Four hundred fifty 1-d-old chicks were divided into 5 treatment groups and fed a corn-soybean diet ad-libitum. The temperature control (CONT) group was held at the normal ambient temperature. Heat stress broilers were held at 35 ± 2°C from d 1 until the termination of the study at d 42. Heat stress groups consisted of HS-CONT fed the basal diet; HS-MOS fed the basal diet containing 0.5% MOS; HS-PM fed the basal diet containing 0.1% PM; and HS-SYN (synbiotic) fed 0.5% MOS and 0.1% PM in the basal diet. Broilers were examined at d 21 and 42 for BW gain, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone concentrations, and ileal microarchitecture. The results revealed that the CONT group had higher (P < 0.01) feed consumption, BW gain, and lower FCR on d 21 and 42, compared with the HS-CONT group. Among supplemented groups, the HS-MOS had higher (P < 0.05) BW gain and lower FCR compared with the HS-CONT group. On d 21 and 42, the HS-CONT group had higher (P < 0.05) serum corticosterone concentrations compared with the CONT and supplemented groups. The CONT group had higher (P < 0.05) villus height, width, surface area, and crypt depth compared with the HS-CONT group. On d 21, the HS-PM had higher (P < 0.05) villus width and surface area compared with HS-CONT group. On d 42, the HS-SYN had higher (P < 0.05) villus width and crypt depth compared with the HS-CONT group. These results showed that chronic HS reduces broiler production performance, intestinal microarchitecture, and increases adrenal hormone concentrations. Also, supplementation of the MOS prebiotic and the PM can partially lessen these changes.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "The potential significance and importance of green iron nanoparticles (Nano-Fe) in poultry production lie in their capability to effectively tackle iron deficiency in poultry. Iron, an indispensable mineral for numerous physiological functions in birds, such as oxygen transport, energy metabolism, and immune response, underscores the critical need for adequate iron levels. Nevertheless, conventional iron supplementation methods frequently face hurdles like limited bioavailability rates in poultry. To enhance performance, and promote sustainable broiler productivity, Nano-Fe showed promise as an efficient feed supplement for broiler chickens. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of green Nano-Fe inclusions in diets on growth, ammonia excretion, carcass criteria, and meat quality in broiler chickens. A total of 192 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks, were assigned to three treatment diets including Nano-Fe oxide at 0, 20, or 40 mg/kg, respectively, for 42 days. Each treatment comprised eight replicates, each with eight broiler chicks. Two phases comprised the 42-day study (0 to 21 days for the starter and 21 to 42 days for the finisher). In comparison to the control group, the Nano-Fe oxide groups 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg linearly improved (<i>p</i> < 0.05) body weight (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.574) and body weight gain (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.367) under hot climatic conditions at 42 days of age. Furthermore, Nano-Fe oxide to broiler diets, improved (linear, <i>p</i> < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.424) throughout whole periods. The feed intake did not show any significant difference (<i>p</i> > 0.05) among groups during the experimental periods under hot climatic conditions. The ammonia content of excreta (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.454) was linearly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with increasing Nano-Fe oxide levels in broiler diets compared to control at 21 and 42 days of age under hot climatic conditions. Nano-Fe oxide positively influences cook loss, water-holding capacity, and iron content in various tissues. Moreover, it contributes to a healthier carcass yield and reduced abdominal fat. In conclusion, broiler chickens fed diets containing Nano-Fe oxide at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg demonstrated enhanced growth performance, improved meat quality, increased iron content in tissues, higher dressing percentage, and reduced abdominal fat deposition. Future research should explore the impact of green Nano-Fe oxide on additional factors such as the microbiome and gene expression related to immunity and heat stress.",

    "abstract": "This experiment was undertaken to evaluate the effect of dietary vitamin E on growth performance and immune response of broilers under heat stress (HS). Birds raised in either a thermoneutral (23.9 degrees C constant) or HS (23.9 to 38 degrees C cycling) environment were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet supplemented with vitamin E at 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg, respectively. Two hundred forty 1-d-old male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 6 groups; each group had 4 replicates of 10 birds. Humoral immunity was assessed by i.v. injection of 7% SRBC followed by evaluation of serum for antibody titers in primary and secondary responses. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed by using a Sephadex stimulation method to recruit abdominal exudate cells (AEC) to evaluate macrophage phagocytic ability. Body weight and feed intake were not significantly influenced by dietary vitamin E (P>0.05), whereas feed conversion was significantly affected by vitamin E at 100 mg/kg (P<0.05). Heat stress significantly reduced BW, feed intake, and feed conversion (P<0.05). Numbers of AEC, percentage of macrophages in AEC, phagocytic macrophages, and internalized opsonized and unopsonized SRBC were increased by dietary vitamin E (P<0.05). Both primary and secondary antibody responses were significantly increased by dietary vitamin E when birds were exposed to HS (P<0.05). Lymphoid organ weights, antibody responses, incidence of macrophages in AEC, and phagocytic ability of macrophages were all significantly reduced under HS. These results indicated that HS severely reduced growth performance and immune response of broilers, whereas the immune response of broilers could be improved by dietary vitamin E supplementation under HS.",

    "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that when using similar protein/amino acid diets and environment temperature conditions, the performance and carbon turnover in muscle and liver tissues, as measured by the incorporation of stable isotopes ((13)C/(12)C), must be different between fast-growing Cobb 500® and slow-growing Label Rouge broilers. For both experiments (Cobb and Label Rouge), 21-d-old birds were distributed in a completely randomised, 3 × 3 factorial design; three environmental temperatures (cyclic heat stress ad libitum, 22°C ad libitum, and 22°C restricted) and three crude protein concentrations (189.1, 210 and 220 g/kg CP) were used. The Cobb 500® had better performance with higher concentrations of crude protein. Cyclic heat stress (a temperature factor), negatively affected this genetic strain's performance. For the Label Rouge birds, the crude protein concentrations in the diet presented inconsistent results and cyclic heat stress did not affect the performance. The carbon turnover rate was affected in the Cobb 500® strain, with a high protein content reducing carbon turnover in the evaluated tissues (liver and muscles). Feed intake had a greater impact on carbon turnover rates than cyclic heat stress. The Label Rouge birds were not affected by the evaluated factors, suggesting that genetic improvement has a leading role on tissue carbon turnover. There is a genetic influence on carbon turnover in the liver and muscle tissues of broiler chickens. In addition, genetically fast-growing broilers are more susceptible to variations in diet composition and environmental temperature than less rapidly growing animals.",

The present study was designed to achieve a reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage to skeletal muscle and to improve the performance of broiler chickens exposed to chronic heat stress. 2. Chickens were given a control diet with normal drinking water, or diets supplemented with cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) or grape seed extract (GSE), or a control diet with electrolysed reduced water (ERW) for 19 d after hatch. Thereafter, chickens were exposed to a temperature of either 34°C continuously for a period of 5 d, or maintained at 24°C, on the same diets. 3. The control broilers exposed to 34°C showed decreased weight gain and feed consumption and slightly increased ROS production and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in skeletal muscle. The chickens exposed to 34°C and supplemented with ERW showed significantly improved growth performance and lower ROS production and MDA contents in tissues than control broilers exposed to 34°C. Following heat exposure, CNSL chickens performed better with respect to weight gain and feed consumption, but still showed elevated ROS production and skeletal muscle oxidative damage. GSE chickens did not exhibit improved performance or reduced skeletal muscle oxidative damage. 4. In conclusion, this study suggests that ERW could partially inhibit ROS-induced oxidative damage to skeletal muscle and improve growth performance in broiler chickens under medium-term chronic heat treatment.",

There was a reduction (P < 0.05) in body weight and feed intake and an increase (P < 0.05) in feed conversion ratio when broilers exposed to HS. In the overall period of the study (1 to 49 days), growth performance of TN broilers was not affected (P < 0.05) by vitamin E and selenium supplementation. However, under HS condition, broilers receiving 250 mg/kg vitamin E and 0.5 mg/kg selenium consumed more (P < 0.05) feed than that of broilers receiving 250 mg/kg vitamin E alone, but similar (P > 0.05) to that of broilers receiving 250 mg/kg vitamin E and 1 mg/kg selenium. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the breast meat was increased (P < 0.05), but its selenium content was decreased (P < 0.05) by exposure to HS. The breast meat selenium content was increased (P < 0.05) by selenium supplementation. The breast meat selenium content was decreased (P < 0.05) by supplementation of 250 mg/kg vitamin E to diet of TN birds. However, the breast meat selenium content was increased (P < 0.05) by supplementation of vitamin E under HS condition.

Total protein, albumin, globulin, HDL, growth hormone, T3, T4, TAC, CAT, SOD, IL -10, C3, and Lysosomes were significantly increased (P < 0.05). At the same time, cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and MDA, IL-1β, and IFN-γ levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by adding curcumin. Curcumin effectively reversed the heat stress-induced histopathological changes in the liver, spleen, bursa, intestine, and breast muscles. These results indicate that curcumin can mitigate the negative effects of heat stress on health and stimulate immunity and antioxidant status in broiler chickens.",

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "<i>Spirulina</i> has been recognized formerly as a filamentous spiral-shaped blue-green algae but more recently as a genus of photosynthetic bacteria (<i>Arthrospira</i>). This microorganism is considered as a rich source of essential nutrients for human and animals. The present study was conducted to determine potential application of <i>Spirulina</i> for heat-exposed broilers. Two hundred and fifty Cobb 500 chicks with male to female in equal ratio with average initial weight of 615.6 g at 17 days of age were divided into 5 treatments with 5 replicates of 10 chicks. Treatment groups were as follows: positive and negative controls with 0% <i>Spirulina</i> supplement and three <i>Spirulina</i> receiving groups with 5 g/kg (0.5%), 10 g/kg (1%), and 20 g/kg (2%) supplementation. <i>Spirulina</i> receiving groups as well as positive control were exposed to high ambient temperature at 36°C for 6 h/d from 38 to 44 days of age. Biochemical variables were measured in serum samples at 35, 38, 42, and 45 days of broiler chickens age. The results showed that supplementation of the diet with <i>Spirulina</i> decreased concentration of stress hormone and some serum lipid parameters while enhanced humoral immunity response and elevated antioxidant status whereas it didn't meaningfully affect performance characteristics. Nevertheless, feed conversion ratio was improved numerically but not statistically in broilers fed with 1% <i>Spirulina</i> under high ambient temperature. Overall, the present study suggests that alleviation of adverse impacts due to high ambient temperature at biochemical level including impaired enzymatic antioxidant system, elevated stress hormone and lipid profile can be approached in broiler chickens through supplementation of the diet with <i>Spirulina platensis</i>.",

    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "The objective was to investigate the effects of dietary curcumin and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on the performance and physiological responses of broiler chickens under chronic thermal stress. One hundred and sixty day-old male chicks (Ross 308) were divided equally into 4 groups (each contained 4 replicates). On the day 22 of age and thereafter, the first group (TN) was raised in a thermoneutral condition (23 ± 1 °C), while the second group (HS) was subjected to 8 h of thermal stress (34 °C) and both groups fed the basal diet with no supplements. The third (CR) and fourth (AS) groups were subjected to the same thermal stress conditions and fed curcumin-supplemented diet (100 mg curcumin kg<sup>-1</sup> diet) and ASA-supplemented diet (1 g ASA kg<sup>-1</sup> diet), respectively. Dietary treatment had a significant effect on ADFI (P = 0.041), average daily gain (P = 0.013) and final body weight (P = 0.001). The curcumin-supplemented had higher values for these measures compared with other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Also, the dietary curcumin supplement significantly increased the carcass yield as compared to the HS group (P < 0.05). Compared with the HS group, the dietary curcumin and ASA supplements decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde in the breast muscles (P = 0.014). Both dietary supplements exhibited a marked ability to restore the serum TAC, Na and K in heat-stressed broiler chickens. The current study reported a remarkable ability of curcumin supplement to restore the concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the breast muscles of heat-stressed broilers, including α-linolinec acid and Docosahexaenoic acid (P = 0.009 and 0.001, respectively). It could be concluded that supplemental dietary curcumin or ASA enhanced growth performance and antioxidant biomarkers of heat-stressed broilers. Moreover, curcumin might be an effective dietary supplement to alleviate the adverse effect of chronic thermal stress on carcass yield and meat quality.",

    "year": "2005",
    "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to determine broiler response to dietary protein during short (1 wk) or prolonged (>3 wk) heat stress (HS). In experiment 1, 21-d-old birds were kept at 20.3 degrees C (thermoneutral; TN), 27.3 degrees C (medium temperature; MT), or 31.4 degrees C (high temperature; HT) and fed diets with 18, 20, 23, or 26% CP for 21 d. Each treatment consisted of 2 blocks of 3 replicates of 15 birds. In experiment 2, broilers were fed diets with 18 or 26% CP or fed ad libitum 2 diets with 10 or 30% CP. Birds were kept at TN (23.5 degrees C) or slowly introduced to HS from 7 to 14 d of age and kept at HT thereafter (chronic; CHS; 29.4 degrees C), and a third group was moved to HT at 21 d (acute HS; AHS; 29.4 degrees C). There were 16 replicates of 4 chickens per treatment distributed in 2 blocks. Performance, body composition, and protein deposition were ascertained from 21 to 28 d and from 28 to 42 d (short and prolonged exposures, respectively). Feeding high protein diets in experiment 1 resulted in linear improvements in body weight gain and feed:gain (P < 0.001) for MT and HT birds, whereas TN birds exhibited a linear (P < 0.001) response to protein. Feed intake declined as CP increased for HT birds during the third week of the study (P < 0.05). In trial 2, better performance was always observed in TN birds. HS depressed performance, although feeding high CP partially ameliorated this effect under AHS and CHS. Regardless of temperature, choice-fed birds selected high protein diets (mean 25.6% CP) and performed similarly to those fed 26% CP. CHS birds showed similar performance to those under AHS. Efficiency of protein deposition was unaffected (P > 0.05). Level of HS and duration of hyperthermia may determine the response of birds to dietary protein. Discrepancies between the 2 studies in response of birds to protein found after prolonged exposure to HS are discussed in view of the differences in levels of certain amino acids used within each experiment.",

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Oxidative stress injury is one important factor in intestinal mucosal barrier damage. Expression of heat shock protein (HSP)70 is an endogenous mechanism by which living cells adapt to stress. This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of HSP70 on intestinal oxidative stress. Two hundred and forty broilers were injected intraperitoneally with HSP70 inducer l-(1)-glutamine or with the inhibitor quercetin. Twenty-four hours later, they were heat stressed for 0, 2, 3, 5, and 10 h, respectively, at 36 ± 1°C. The l-(1)-glutamine significantly increased HSP70 expression (P < 0.001). At 2 h or 3 h of heat stress, the HSP70 expression obviously elevated (P < 0.001). Levels of corticosterone and the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio significantly increased when HSP70 expression was inhibited (P < 0.0001). Serum corticosterone was negatively correlated with the HSP70 expression at 3 h of heat stress (P = 0.0015; R = -0.6537). Heat shock protein 70 significantly protected the integrity of the intestinal mucosa from heat stress, with significantly decreased lactic dehydrogenase when HSP70 expression was enhanced (P < 0.001). In addition, heat-stress time significantly affected the lactic dehydrogenase release (P < 0.001). Furthermore, HSP70 significantly elevated antioxidant enzyme activities (such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity) and inhibited lipid peroxidation to relieve intestinal mucosal oxidative injury (P < 0.001). These results suggest that HSP70 is capable of protecting the intestinal mucosa from heat-stress injury by improving antioxidant capacity of broilers and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation production.",

    "year": "2006",
    "abstract": "1. One hundred and eighty 1-d-old broiler chicks were used to evaluate the effect upon broiler performance during severely hot summer months of three different sodium salts: sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), in starter and finisher diets having an identical electrolyte balance (DEB) of 250 mEq/kg. 2. The non-chloride sodium salts were added to contribute the same amount of sodium and were substituted at the expense of builder's sand in the basal diets containing common salt (NaCl) as Na and Cl source. 3. Each diet was fed to three experimental units having 15 chicks each until 42 d of age. Severe heat-stress conditions, maintained in the rearing room, were indicated by high average weekly room temperature (minimum 29.3 degrees C; maximum 38.0 degrees C). 4. Diets containing sodium salts gave better body weight gain, feed intake and feed to gain ratio than the control diet. Sodium salts also enhanced water intake as well as water to feed intake ratio. This effect was more pronounced in broilers fed NaHCO3 supplement (with NaCl in the basal diets). 5. The increased water intake resulted in lower body temperature in heat-stressed birds fed NaHCO3 supplemented diet than in birds fed other sodium salts. A lower mortality rate was noted with NaHCO3 (15.15%), Na2CO3 (13.64%) and Na2SO4 (15.15%) supplements than with the control (33.33%) treatment. 6. Better carcase and parts yield were observed in sodium supplemented broilers. Sodium salts reduced the alkalotic pH and enhanced the blood sodium content, which ultimately improved the blood electrolyte balance and overall performance of heat-stressed broilers. 7. Supplementing broiler diets with sodium salts improved the live performance of heat-stressed broilers and better productive performance was noted with NaHCO3 than other sodium supplements.",

The main factors were diet (basal diet or basal diet supplemented with 0.15% astaxanthin-rich dried cell powder (Panaferd-P [astaxanthin 30 ppm]) and ambient temperature (thermo-neutral [25 ± 1°C] or high [35 ± 1°C for 6 hr]). Dietary supplementation with Panaferd-P did not affect growth performance, though high ambient temperature decreased feed intake and the weight of breast tender muscle, liver, and heart. High ambient temperature also decreased redness in both breast and leg muscles of chickens, while Panaferd-P increased redness and yellowness of breast and leg muscles of chickens. Panaferd-P increased Paracoccus carotinifaciens-derived pigments (i.e., adonixanthin, astaxanthin, adonirubin, and cantaxanthin) as well as corn-derived pigments such as zeaxanthin and lutein in breast and leg muscles. High ambient temperature increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in breast muscle, while Panaferd-P decreased the MDA concentration in breast muscle under both temperature conditions. Our results suggest that dietary supplementation with Panaferd-P increases muscle carotenoid content, the redness and yellowness of meat and decreases the muscle MDA concentration in broiler chickens kept under thermo-neutral or high ambient temperature conditions.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of vitamin C (Vit C) supplementation on broiler performance, blood parameters, carcass characteristics and meat quality under heat stress. Based on searches conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science, 35 studies published in authoritative journals from 1985 to 2023 were meta-analysed. Heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression analysis. The results of this meta-analysis showed that the body weight (BW, SMD = +0.339, p = 0.003) and average daily gain (ADG, SMD = +0.381, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the group receiving Vit C supplementation under heat stress compared to the control group. However, Vit C supplementation did not have a significant effect on feed intake (FI, SMD = +0.084, p = 0.245), but the results were significant for the feed conversion ratio (FCR, SMD = -0.529, p = 0.001). Breast, thigh, abdominal fat, carcass drop loss, liver, gizzard, heart and spleen were not affected by Vit C supplementation, but it has a significant effect on wing weight (SMD = -3.77, p = 0.001). The use of Vit C supplementation decreased triglyceride (SMD = -0.527, p = 0.001), cholesterol (SMD = -0.976, p = 0.001) and blood glucose (SMD = -0.734, p = 0.02) concentrations in the broiler under heat stress. Breast meat quality (L*, a* and b*) was not affected by Vit C supplementation. In the current study, most of the responses had high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> > 50%). The findings of this meta-analysis demonstrated that, in broiler chickens under heat stress, adding Vit C supplementation to the feed can enhance performance. However, Vit C did not have a significant effect on carcass characteristics and the quality of the breast meat of broiler chickens. According to our meta-analysis results, utilisation of 250 mg/kg of Vit C is recommended as an effective growth promoter in broiler under heat stress, and as an antioxidant compound, it had a positive effect on reducing blood TG and TC.",

The effects of α-lipoic acid administration on sexual differences in growth performance, heat exposure-induced metabolic response and lipid peroxidation of raw meat in broiler chickens were studied. 2. Two-week-old male and female broiler chicks were divided into two groups each, as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Half the birds were fed on a diet supplemented with α-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg) and half on a control diet. All groups were reared to 6 weeks of age at 25°C and, thereafter, exposed to 33°C for 8 h per day for 3 d. 3. Under thermo-neutral conditions, α-lipoic acid decreased feed consumption and body weight gain of male chickens. However, the feed conversion rate and tissue mass of breast muscle and abdominal fat were unchanged. 4. In plasma metabolites, α-lipoic acid increased the molar ratio of non-esterified fatty acids to free glycerol, regardless of sex and heat exposure. A decrease in β-hydroxybutyrate was observed in the α-lipoic acid-fed male chickens. In the heat-exposed chickens, α-lipoic acid lowered the molar ratio of plasma lactate to pyruvate in relation to the enhanced concentrations of plasma pyruvate. However, no sexual difference was observed. 5. The value of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in breast meat of heat-stressed chickens that was refrigerated for 3 or 7 d was higher in males than in females. An antioxidative effect of α-lipoic acid was observed in the meat of male chickens. 6. The present study suggests that the α-lipoic acid-inducing fatty acid metabolism and antioxidative effect persisted during the heat stress, even though a sexual difference in the responsiveness was seen in broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the effects of acute heat stress and subsequent stress removal on function of hepatic mitochondrial respiration, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in broiler chickens, 128 six-week-old broiler chickens were kept in a controlled-environment chamber. The broiler chickens were initially kept at 25 degrees C (relative humidity, RH, 70+/-5%) for 6d and subsequently exposed to 35 degrees C (RH, 70+/-5%) for 3h, then the heat stress was removed and the temperature returned to 25 degrees C (RH, 70+/-5%). Blood and liver samples were obtained before heat exposure and at 0 (at the end of the three-hour heating episode, this group is also abbreviated as the HT group), 1, 2, 4, 8, 12h after the stress was removed. The results showed that acute heat stress induced a significant production of ROS, function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, antioxidative enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)] activity, and formation of malondialdehybe (MDA). Within the first 12h after removal of the heat stress, the acute modification of the above parameters induced by heat stress gradually approached to pre-heat levels. The results of the present study suggest that acute exposure to high temperatures may depress the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This leads to over-production of ROS, which ultimately results in lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. When the high temperature was removed, the production of ROS, mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative injury that were induced by acute heat exposure gradually approached the levels observed before heating, in a time-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "High ambient temperature is a major problem in commercial broiler production in the humid tropics because high producing broiler birds consume more feed, have higher metabolic activity, and thus higher body heat production. To evaluate the effects of two previously isolated potential probiotic strains (Lactobacillus pentosus ITA23 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ITA44) on broilers growing under heat stress condition, a total of 192 chicks were randomly allocated into four treatment groups of 48 chickens each as follows: CL, birds fed with basal diet raised in 24 °C; PL, birds fed with basal diet plus 0.1 % probiotic mixture raised in 24 °C; CH, birds fed with basal diet raised in 35 °C; and PH, birds fed with basal diet plus 0.1 % probiotic mixture raised in 35 °C. The effects of probiotic mixture on the performance, expression of nutrient absorption genes of the small intestine, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbial population of cecal contents, antioxidant capacity of liver, and fatty acid composition of breast muscle were investigated. Results showed that probiotic positively affected the final body weight under both temperature conditions (PL and PH groups) compared to their respective control groups (CL and CH). Probiotic supplementation numerically improved the average daily gain (ADG) under lower temperature, but significantly improved ADG under the higher temperature (P < 0.05) by sustaining high feed intake. Under the lower temperature environment, supplementation of the two Lactobacillus strains significantly increased the expression of the four sugar transporter genes tested (GLUT2, GLUT5, SGLT1, and SGLT4) indicating probiotic enhances the absorption of this nutrient. Similar but less pronounced effect was also observed under higher temperature (35 °C) condition. In addition, the probiotic mixture improved bacterial population of the cecal contents, by increasing beneficial bacteria and decreasing Escherichia coli population, which could be because of higher production of VFA in the cecum, especially at heat stress condition. The two Lactobacillus strains also improved the fatty acid profile of meat, including at heat stress. Generally, the two Lactobacillus strains can be considered as good potential probiotics for chickens due to their good probiotic properties and remarkable efficacy on broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress is known to impair performance and to induce oxidative stress in poultry. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of dietary supplementation of dl-methionine (dl-M) or the synthetic analog 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (dl-HMTBA) on broiler growth performance, plasma hormone levels, and some oxidative stress-related parameters under conditions of chronic exposure to high temperatures (HT). From 2 to 6 wk of age, male broiler chickens were reared under either a constant temperature of 32°C until 6 wk of age or a normal temperature scheme (gradual decrease to 18°C at 5 wk of age). Chicks in both the normal and HT treatments were provided with a commercial grower diet supplemented with either 1.0 or 1.2 g/kg of dl-M or 1.0 or 1.2 g/kg of dl-HMTBA. Because there were no effects of supplement dose, data were pooled over both doses within each temperature treatment. The chronic HT treatment impaired feed intake and BW gain, but these negative effects were less pronounced when the chickens received dl-HMTBA. Exposure to HT was also associated with decreased (P < 0.001) plasma thyroid hormones and increased (P < 0.0001) plasma corticosterone levels. At 4 wk of age, and irrespective of the supplemental source, chickens subjected to HT were characterized by significantly lower plasma TBA-reactive substance levels. In contrast, at 6 wk of age, plasma TBA-reactive substance levels were significantly increased by HT, but this effect was observed only for the chickens receiving dl-M and not for those receiving dl-HMTBA. High temperatures induced a significant increase in hepatic total glutathione (GSH) and oxidized GSH levels, regardless of the supplemental source. However, the hepatic ratios of reduced GSH to total GSH and reduced GSH to oxidized GSH were highest in chickens supplemented with dl-HMTBA. In conclusion, dl-HMTBA supplementation partially prevented the growth-depressing effects of chronic heat exposure compared with dl-M supplementation. It can be inferred that dl-HMTBA is more efficient in alleviating HT-induced oxidative damage because of a more favorable reduced GSH-to-total GSH ratio.",

    "abstract": "Pressure to reduce the use of antibiotics in the poultry industry has intensified research on alternative solutions to support intestinal health, including but not limited to direct fed microbials (DFM). Heat stress is known to impact intestinal health and function. The aim of this study was to determine efficacy of a water applied DFM product on broiler performance during the summer period. One of two treatments were randomly allocated to 12 replicate floor pens each: a control treatment and a treatment provided daily with a dual strain DFM comprised of Lactobacillus acidophilus AG01 and Bifidobacterium animalis AG02 at 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/bird/d. Each pen contained 20 Ross 308 broilers. All birds were fed the same three-phased wheat- and soybean meal-based diets. Body weight, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and mortality were measured at d 0, 10, 24, 35, and 42. Due to natural extreme external temperature conditions, all birds were subject to heat stress during the end of the grower phase up to and including the finisher phase. Temperature was on average 5°C higher compared to industry recommendation. No significant differences were found in growth performance between the control and DFM treatment, yet BW at d 42 in both treatments was reduced by 19% compared to the breed standard. The DFM treatment significantly reduced mortality among the birds. Overall mortality from d 1 to d 35 was reduced from 4.58% to 0.42% (P = 0.023) and overall mortality from d 1 to d 42 was reduced from 5.83 to 0.83% (P = 0.027). This was driven by the difference in heat-stress related mortality in the finisher phase from d 25 to d 42, where mortality reached only 0.44% in the DFM treatment versus 2.88% in the unsupplemented control treatment. Post-mortem analysis confirmed heat-stress related hypoxia. In conclusion, the dual strain DFM may have provided improved (intestinal) homeostasis and barrier function allowing increased resilience to heat stress in broilers.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of thyme and peppermint extract sprays on eggs, emphasizing their antioxidant properties and impact on poultry embryo growth. Key evaluated traits included embryonic quality, hatchling metrics, yolk sac residue, intestinal morphology, and broiler performance during the first week, alongside blood stress indicators. A 5 × 2 factorial experiment was conducted on 1500 eggs treated with ascorbic acid, peppermint extract, thyme extract, distilled water, or no spray, under both normal and heat stress conditions. The results revealed that thyme and peppermint sprays significantly increased egg weight and reduced water loss. Peppermint extract increased yolk sac weight on day 18 (P < 0.05), while thyme extract decreased embryonic mortality under normal temperatures. However, peppermint extract and ascorbic acid negatively affected mortality and incubation time, respectively (P < 0.05). Thyme extract reduced the yolk sac-to-chick weight ratio in hatched chicks under normal conditions. Under heat stress, untreated chicks had higher body surface temperatures compared to those treated with ascorbic acid (P < 0.05). Thyme extract reduced cortisol levels and white blood cell counts under heat stress compared to peppermint extract (P < 0.05). Thyme extract also improved intestinal morphology in heat-stressed chicks, increasing villus height and the villus-to-crypt depth ratio. Peppermint under heat stress and ascorbic acid under normal conditions increased crypt depth, while ascorbic acid under heat stress improved villus width. Thyme extract additionally increased goblet cell numbers compared to distilled water (P < 0.05). Forty-eight hours post-hatch, heat stress elevated chicks' body temperatures, while thyme extract sprays significantly reduced them (P < 0.05). Chicks sprayed with distilled water under heat stress showed the highest weight gain. In conclusion, thyme extract spray is an effective intervention for improving hatchability, yolk sac absorption, intestinal morphology, and reducing cortisol levels under heat stress, offering practical applications for enhancing poultry production efficiency and health.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) in reduced protein (RP) diets on performance and gut health of broilers under heat stress is largely unknown. A 35-d experiment was conducted using four dietary treatments: a standard protein diet (SP, 22.1 and 20.7% CP in grower and finisher), a RP diet (20.1 and 18.7% in grower and finisher), a RP diet with 0.092% GAA per kg diet substituting 50% of supplemented arginine (GAA50) at one-to-one ratio and a RP diet with the same amount of GAA added on top (GAAtop). Day-old male Ross 308 chicks were assigned to 64 pens (10 birds each) in two rooms. In each room, each diet was replicated 8 times. From d 25 to 35, birds in one room were subjected to a cyclic heat stress (32±1 °C for 8 h). There was no interaction between diets and heat stress for any of the studied parameters. GAA50 followed by GAAtop significantly decreased the feed intake during the finisher phase (P<0.01) and from d 10 to 35 (P<0.001), compared with SP diet. Heat stress reduced (P<0.0001) feed intake and body weight gain at all stages of the study but did not impact FCR. The GAA50 tended to reduce FCR from d 24 to 35 (P=0.086) and d 10 to 35 (P=0.082) compared with SP and RP. Heat stress increased (P<0.05) intestinal permeability whereas diets had no effect. The gene expression of IL1β was downregulated (P<0.01) by GAA50 but diet had no effect on other selected genes. Heat stress upregulated the expression of several genes including Claudin 2, Claudin 3, GPX-1, HSP70, IL1β, SOD-1 and AMPK-α1. Caecal microbiota composition remained unaffected. The results indicate that replacing 50% of supplemented arginine with GAA tends to improve FCR by reducing the feed intake under both thermoneutral and heat stress conditions without any interaction. Supplementation of GAA or two percentage points reduction of dietary protein had no demonstrable effects on parameters of intestinal health.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "High ambient temperature (heat stress, HS) is one of the critical environmental factors causing gut microbiota dysbiosis and increasing gut permeability, consequently inciting neuroinflammation in humans and various animals including chickens. The aim of this study was to examine if a probiotic, Bacillus subtilis, can reduce neuroinflammation in heat-stressed broiler chickens. Two hundred and forty 1-d-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 48 pens among 4 treatments in 2 identical, thermal-controlled rooms (n = 12): Thermoneutral (TN)-regular diet (RD), TN-PD (the regular diet mixed with a probiotic at 250 ppm), HS-RD, and HS-PD. The probiotic diet was fed from d 1, and HS at 32°C for 10-h daily was applied from d 15 for a 43-day trial. Results showed that compared to the TN broilers, the HS broilers had higher hippocampal interleukin (IL)-6, toll-like receptor (TLR)4, and heat shock protein (HSP)70 at both mRNA and protein levels regardless of dietary treatment (P < 0.05). In addition, the HS-PD broilers had higher levels of hippocampal IL-8 (P < 0.05) than the TN-PD broilers. Within the HS groups, compared to the HS-RD broilers, the HS-PD broilers had lower levels of IL-6, IL-8, HSP70, and TLR4 (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus. Within the TN groups, the TN-PD broilers had lower IL-8 at both mRNA expressions and protein levels (P < 0.05) but higher TLR4 protein levels (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus as compared to the TN-RD broilers. These results indicate that dietary supplementation of the Bacillus subtilis-based probiotic may reduce HS-induced brain inflammatory reactions in broilers via the gut-brain-immune axis. These results indicate the potential use of probiotics as a management strategy for reducing the impact of HS on poultry production.",

This study evaluated the effects of zinc methionine (Zn-met) and selenium (Se) yeast on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immune function and intestinal morphology of broiler chickens under heat stress (HS).2. A total of 54, yellow-feather male broilers (35-d old) were randomly allocated to one of three groups; a control group (CON) fed a basal diet and maintained at 26 ± 1°C, a group fed the basal diet with cyclic HS alone or + Zn-met + Se yeast group (HZS) fed a basal diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg Zn-met and 150 mg/kg Se yeast. After the 7-d prep-trial period, the birds in the HS and the HZS groups were exposed to cyclic HS treatment (30 ± 1 to 34 ± 1°C) from d 8 for 2 weeks.3. The HS treated birds had reduced body weight, daily gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and increased mortality and rectal temperature, whereas the HZS group had a lower mortality rate and rectal temperature. The HS group had higher blood triglyceride (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and lower potassium (0.05) levels than the CON group. Exposure to HS increased the lipopolysaccharide levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and decreased the levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG (<i>p</i> < 0.05), which were improved in the HZS group. The HZS group reversed the increase in blood catalase activity caused by heat stress and increased glutathione peroxidase levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Heat stress decreased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum, increased the crypt depth and decreased the villus height to crypt depth ratio in the small intestine, which were improved in the HZS group (<i>p</i> < 0.05).4. Dietary supplementation with Zn-met and Se yeast was shown to be an effective nutritional regulation strategy for alleviating any negative effects of heat stress in broiler performance.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Poultry production is confronting real challenges, including a lofty projected high demand for animal proteins to feed the future, and the need to adapt to planetary boundaries (global warming) with limited natural resources (land, energy, water). Among the most challenging stressors to poultry production sustainability are heat stress (HS) and water uncertainty, that need extensive fundamental and applied research to identify effective strategies. In that regard, our group has recently developed a high-water-efficient broiler (meat-type) chicken line using water conversion ratio (WCR) as a phenotypic trait and defined the hypothalamic molecular mechanisms controlling drinking water under heat stress conditions. In response to the invitation from the Organizing Committee of the 13th International Symposium on Avian Endocrinology (ISAE 2024), the present review summarizes these data and closes the chapter by asking questions for future investigations. Data showed that HS exposure increased core body temperature (CBT) of both lines, with higher degree in HWE than in LWE counterparts. Despite this increase in CBT, HWE line drank less water but had superior performance with better feed conversion ratio (FCR) and WCR than LWE line. Molecular analyses showed that hypothalamic drinking-related neuropeptides (arginine vasopressin system, aquaporin system, renin, and angiotensin system) are affected in line- and/or environmental-dependent manner. Together, our research outcome indicates that the divergent selection for water efficiency could be an effective strategy to preserve water while maintaining optimal growth performance and could be applied to other poultry species and livestock.",

    "abstract": "The negative effects of high ambient temperature during some months of the year on poultry production have been of great concern in many countries. Dietary modifications are among the most practical ways to alleviate the effects of high temperature. Possible effects of dietary supplementation with 200 or 400 mg/kg feed of lemon peel extract (LPE), orange peel extract (OPE) and Curcuma xanthorrhiza essential oil (CXEO) under hot conditions (34 °C with 50% relative humidity for 5 h daily starting from day 28 until day 38 of age) on blood antioxidant enzyme activities, biochemical parameters and antibody titres of broiler chickens were investigated. All extracts are rich in phenolic compounds and highly available. Compared to control, supplementation with OPE at 400 mg/kg and CXEO significantly increased erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity, plasma growth hormone concentrations and serum phosphorus, total protein and chloride concentrations and decreased serum low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol concentrations in chickens at 38 days of age. Regarding antibody titres, CXEO supplementation at 400 mg/kg caused a significant increase in bronchitis antibody titres. Supplementation with LPE and OPE gave more inconsistent results. Most interesting, 400 mg/kg LPE significantly increased 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine and GH concentration as compared to the control. In conclusion, the herbal extracts tested in this study, in particular CXEO at 400 mg/kg, may relieve some of the changes in blood composition induced by increased ambient temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary magnesium sulfate supplementation on heat stress-induced oxidative damage in broilers. One hundred twenty 14-day-old broilers were randomly assigned into four treatment groups with three replicates of ten birds each. The broilers were reared under normal ambient temperature (24 ± 1°C) fed with a basal (control) diet or reared under high ambient temperature (35 ± 1°C between 1000 and 1800 h, 8 h each day) fed with a basal diet supplemented with magnesium sulfate (0, 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg of diet) from 14 to 42 days of age. Growth performance and oxidative damage were evaluated in each treatment group. Our results demonstrated that dietary magnesium sulfate supplementation significantly prevented heat stress-induced oxidative damage and improved growth performance in broilers compared with that of control. Mechanistically, this beneficial effect was mediated, at least partly, by restoring the activity of anti-oxidative enzymes. This finding suggests that magnesium sulfate supplementation might be a potential strategy to attenuate heat stress-induced detrimental effects in broilers raised in summer season or tropical areas.",

One-day-old 240 male broilers were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, six replicates of ten birds each. The birds were fed with either a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with either 200 mg L-ascorbic acid/kg of diet, 250 mg of oregano essential oil/kg of diet, or 200 mg L-ascorbic acid plus 250 mg of oregano essential oil/kg of diet. Average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were obtained for 42 days of age and at the end of the experiment (day 42); birds were bled to determine some blood parameters and weighted for final body weight (BW). Feeding birds with diets supplemented with oregano essential oil and vitamin C in a single or combined form increased ADG (P > 0.05). Also BW increased and feed efficiency decreased (P < 0.05) in the birds fed with diets including VC and OR (in a single or combined form), compared to those fed the basal diet. ADFI was not significantly influenced by dietary oregano essential oil and vitamin C (P > 0.05). Supplemental oregano essential oil and vitamin C in a combined form decreased the serum concentration of corticosterone, triglycerides, glucose, and MDA (P < 0.05) compared with other groups. An increase in the serum concentrations of vitamin C were seen in broiler chicks supplemented with vitamin C. From the results of the present experiment, it can be concluded that diet supplementation by combined oregano essential oil and vitamin C could have beneficial effects on some blood parameters of broiler chicks reared under heat stress condition.",

A total of 150 one-day-old broiler chicks according to a completely randomized design were assigned into five treatment groups. Each treatment consisted of three replicates and each replicate contained ten chicks. Chicks were fed on corn-soybean meal basal diets with added different concentrations of chromium (0, 600 and 1,200 μg kg(-1) chromium chloride or 600 and 1,200 μg/kg chromium L-methionine) from 1 to 49 days of age. Humoral immunity was assessed by intravenous injection of 7% sheep red blood cell (SRBC) followed by evaluation of serum for antibody titers in primary and secondary responses. Cell-mediated immunity was assessed by the cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) test to phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-P at day 32 and PHA-M at day 48. Heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio was also measured as a reliable indicator of stress. The body mass, feed intake and conversion ratio were not influenced by dietary chromium (P > 0.05). Dietary supplementation of both organic and inorganic chromium significantly increased primary and secondary antibody responses (P < 0.01), and also improved H/L ratio (P < 0.05), CBH response (P < 0.01) as well as relative weights of thymus (P < 0.05) and spleen (P < 0.01). Both dietary organic and inorganic chromium caused an increase in serum concentrations of Cr and Zn (P < 0.01), but decreased the serum concentration of Cu (P < 0.01).

Birds fed 1,500 μg/kg Cr nicotinate, had lower concentration of serum glucose and triglyceride at 21 days (P < 0.05). Hematological parameters tested at 21 and 42 days, were not influenced. The results suggested that dietary Cr supplementation regardless of its source have a positive effect on productive, and carcass traits, also enhances oxidative stability of refrigerated meat in broilers reared under heat stress conditions.",

Performance responses were closely monitored per growth phase (starter 1-10d, grower 11-24, finisher 25-40) and overall. At the end of the experiment (d40), duodenal and liver samples from 7 broilers per treatment were appropriately collected, snap frozen and subsequently stored at -80°C until gene expression analysis. Results revealed that PB inclusion level, improved (P < 0.05) Feed Conversion Ratio, Protein Efficiency Ratio, Energy Efficiency Ratio and the Nutritional Efficiency in a quadratic manner, compared to CON. At the molecular level, PB inclusion down-regulated (P < 0.05) most of the heat shock and inflammation-related genes, both in the duodenum and liver, in a linear manner with PB inclusion level. In addition, PΒ cytoprotective capacity was demonstrated via beneficial changes (P < 0.05) seen for the majority of the antioxidant and detoxification-related genes assessed, with the PB1500 displaying most significant differences, compared to CON.

Dried plum (DP) is a rich source of minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and phenolic compounds. Studies have indicated that DP offers various health advantages, including preserving the body's redox system, immune function, and calcium balance. In our previous study, DP supplementation improved overall growth performance and intestinal health metrics in heat-stressed broilers. Considering the beneficial effects of DP on health, we hypothesized that adding DP to the diet would mitigate the harmful impacts of heat stress in the liver of broiler chickens. Day-old unsexed broiler chicks (n = 72) were raised under standard conditions and randomly assigned to three treatment groups (n = 24/group): 1) Control, 2) heat stress with basal diet (HS), and 3) heat stress with supplement (DP). During the finisher stage, the DP group received feed containing 2.5% DP during treatment, while the other groups were given a standard finisher diet. After 21 d, birds in the HS and DP groups were subjected to cyclic heat stress conditions for 3 wk. The heat stress conditions involved exposing the birds to a temperature of 33-35°C for 8 h during the daytime. In contrast, the birds in the Control group were raised under normal conditions with temperatures ranging from 22-24°C. DP supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) expression in the liver compared to the Control group. DP supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) thioredoxin (TXN), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD4) expression in the DP group compared to the HS group. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FPB1) expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the DP group compared to the HS group. Solute Carrier Family 3 Member 1 (SLC3A1), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (Tet3), and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) expression were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the DP group compared to the other treatment groups. In conclusion, post-hatch DP supplementation lessened the negative effects of HS on broiler chickens by upregulating genes related to heat shock, antioxidants, growth, nutrient transporters, and epigenetics in the liver.",

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine if a diet supplemented simultaneously with vitamins C and E would alleviate the negative effects of heat stress, applied between 28 and 42 days of age, on performance, carcass and meat quality traits of broiler chickens. A total of 384 male broiler chickens were assigned to a completely randomized design, with a 2×3 factorial arrangement (diet with or without vitamin supplementation and two ambient temperatures plus a pair-feeding group) and 16 replicates. Chickens were kept in thermoneutral conditions up to 28 days of age. They were then housed in groups of four per cage, in three environmentally controlled chambers: two thermoneutral (22.5 and 22.6°C) and one for heat stress (32°C). Half the chickens were fed a diet supplemented with vitamins C (257 to 288 mg/kg) and E (93 to 109 mg/kg). In the thermoneutral chambers, half of the chickens were pair-fed to heat stressed chickens, receiving each day the average feed intake recorded in the heat stress chamber in the previous day. Meat physical quality analyses were performed on the pectoralis major muscle. No ambient temperature×diet supplementation interaction effects were detected on performance, carcass, or meat quality traits. The supplemented diet resulted in lower growth performance, attributed either to a carry-over effect of the lower initial BW, or to a possible catabolic effect of vitamins C and E when supplemented simultaneously at high levels. Heat stress reduced slaughter and carcass weights, average daily gain and feed intake, and increased feed conversion. Growth performance of pair-fed chickens was similar to that of heat stressed chickens. Exposure to heat stress increased carcass and abdominal fat percentages, but reduced breast, liver and heart percentages. Pair-fed chickens showed the lowest fat percentage and their breast percentage was similar to controls. Heat stress increased meat pH and negatively affected meat color and cooking loss. In pair-fed chickens, meat color was similar to the heat stressed group. Shear force was not influenced by heat stress, but pair-fed chickens showed the tenderest meat. In conclusion, reduction in growth performance and negative changes in meat color in heat stressed chickens were attributed to depression in feed intake, whereas negative changes in body composition, higher meat pH and cooking loss were credited to high ambient temperature per se. Diet supplementation with vitamins C and E as antioxidants did not mitigate any of these negative effects.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of wheat germ oil (WGO), Bacillus subtilis, and their combination on growth performance, immune response, nutrient digestibility, intestinal microbial, oxidative status, and gene expression in heat-stressed broilers. Four hundred one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were distributed into five pens (20 birds/pen) in four experimental groups: a control (CON) without additives, WGO group fed diet with WGO at 200 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>, BS group fed diet with B. subtilis at 500 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> containing 5 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU.g<sup>-1</sup>, and CWB group received both WGO and B. subtilis. Heat stress exposure adversely affected broiler growth performance, carcass traits, immune response, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and mucin2 (MUC2) mRNA expression. However, the CWB group showed a lower FCR, reduced mortality rate, and increased BWG compared to the other groups. Nutrient digestion was also improved, with a higher digestibility of ether extract, dry matter, and crude protein. By day 35, stress biomarkers like corticosterone and glucose levels were reduced, while triiodothyronine levels increased in the BS and CWB groups. The CWB group also showed lower malondialdehyde and interleukin-6 levels, with higher superoxide dismutase activity, and increased levels of IgA, IgG, and interleukin-10. Additionally, the CWB group had higher HDL levels and lower cholesterol and LDL levels (P < 0.05). Notably, CWB supplements modified the structure of the cecal microbial community by increasing Lactobacillus counts and decreasing E. coli and C. perfringens counts. Furthermore, the expressions of intestinal MUC2 and hepatic IGF-1 were up-regulated (P < 0.05) in the CWB group. This study provides evidence that supplementing heat-stressed broiler diets with a mixture of WGO and B. subtilis enhances antioxidant capacity, immune response, growth performance, and gut integrity via modulating the microbial community and regulating gene expression.",

    "title": "Melatonin supplementation can ameliorate the detrimental effects of heat stress on performance and carcass traits of Japanese quail.",
    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "Melatonin, the major pineal hormone, modulates growth in poultry by influencing hormones involved in growth. We investigated the effects of dietary melatonin supplementation on performance, carcass characteristics, and excretion of nitrogen and some minerals in broiler Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) exposed to high-ambient-temperature stress (34 degrees C). One hundred twenty Japanese quails (10 d old) were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups, 3 replicates of 10 birds each. The birds were kept in either an environment-controlled room at a constant 22 degrees C or were kept at 22 degrees C for 16 h/d and at 34 degrees C for 8 h/d (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). At both temperatures birds were fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 40 mg of melatonin per kilogram of diet. The experiment lasted for 32 d. Melatonin improved feed efficiency in both temperatures groups compared with their corresponding controls. Although feed intake was similar in all groups, the improvement in feed efficiency was more noticeable in melatonin-fed quails kept at high temperature (p< 0.01). Supplemental melatonin significantly increased live weight gain and carcass characteristics under stress conditions (p < 0.01) but did not show the same effect at thermoneutral conditions (p > 0.05). Heat exposure increased excretion of N, Ca, P, Zn, Fe, and Cr and decreased retention rates for them. Dietary melatonin supplementation returned these values to normal (p < 0.01). No interactions between melatonin and temperature were found in the parameters measured. The results of the study show that melatonin supplementation attenuated the retardation in performance as well as the excretion of minerals caused by heat stress in broiler quails. Our data suggest that melatonin might offer protection against heat-stress-related depression in the performance of broiler quails.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplemental methionine (Met) source and betaine (Bet) replacement for Met on performance and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes (MRCEs) in normal and heat-stressed broiler chickens. Total of 1,200-day-old Ross 308 chicks were allocated to two houses, each consisted of 12 treatments, five replicates of 10 birds each with 2 × 2×3 × 2 (temperature × Met source × Met level × Bet, respectively) split-plot factorial arrangement. Met level in the basal diets was 70% requirements (Req) that was increased to the requirement or 130% by supplemental dl- or l-Met. Bet was or was not substituted at the rate of 30% supplemental dl- or l-Met. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) in chicks fed 70% l-Met was lower than those fed 70% dl-Met diet during 1-10 days (p = 0.04). Broilers fed diets containing requirement or 130% Met, regardless of its source, showed higher weight gain (WG) than those received 70% Met diet during 11-42 days (p < 0.001). Feed intake (FI) of broilers fed 130% Met diet was decreased compared to other two groups during 11-42 days (p < 0.05). One hundred thirty percent Met requirement diet resulted in lower FCR comparing to other two groups during 11-42 days (p < 0.001). Heat-stressed birds grew less than those under normal condition (p < 0.05). Broilers fed Req Met diet under normal temperature exhibited higher activities of complexes (Cox) I and III (p < 0.05). Cox I activity in heat-stressed birds fed Bet + diet was similar to those fed Bet-diet under normal temperature (p = 0.046). It is concluded that performance and the activities of Cox I and III were increased as the level of Met increased. Bet replacement for 30% supplemental Met resulted in similar consequences comparing to non-Bet replacement diets on performance, but increased the activity of Cox III. l-Met was effective than dl-Met at the cellular level. High ambient temperature depressed performance and MRCE activity.",

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "Two trials were conducted to determine the non-phytate phosphorus (nPP) requirement for broiler under heat stress. In both trials, birds were distributed in a completely randomized 4 × 2 factorial design with four nPP concentrations: 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.55%, and two Ca supply techniques: Ca fixed at 0.899% (CaF) or varying along with nPP aiming a 2:1 Ca to nPP ratio (CaV). Both trials had eight pens/treatment, with nine and five birds/pen for exp. 1 and exp. 2, respectively. nPP concentration had no effect on feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), nor fat deposition ratio (FDR). nPP levels showed a linear effect on protein deposition ratio (PDR) only for CaF diets. The nPP levels had a significant effect, regardless the technique adopted, on tibia phosphorus (TibP), which varied quadratically, on tibia calcium (TibCa) that increased quadratically and linearly, respectively, on CaF and CaV diets, and on tibia ash (TibAsh) that showed a quadratic effect for both. No effect was observed on Ca to P ratio in the tibia (TibCa:TibP). The nPP levels showed a linear increase effect over phosphorus intake (PI), phosphorus excreted (PE), and phosphorus retained (PR), and a linear decrease effect on phosphorus retention coefficient (PRC). Therefore, the nPP requirement for broilers from 8 to 21 days of age that provided better performance and bone variables were 0.250 and 0.484%, respectively, for CaF diets and 0.250 and 0.511%, respectively, for CaV diets.",

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Heat stress due to high environmental temperature negatively influences animal performances. To better understand the biological impact of heat stress, laying broiler breeder chickens were subjected either to acute (step-wisely increasing temperature from 21 to 35°C within 24 hours) or chronic (32°C for 8 weeks) high temperature exposure. High temperature challenges significantly elevated body temperature of experimental birds (P<0.05). However, oxidation status of lipid and protein and expression of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) 70 and 90 were differently affected by acute and chronic treatment. Tissue-specific responses to thermal challenge were also found among heart, liver and muscle. In the heart, acute heat challenge affected lipid oxidation (P = 0.05) and gene expression of all 4 HSF gene expression was upregulated (P<0.05). During chronic heat treatment, the HSP 70 mRNA level was increased (P<0.05) and HSP 90 mRNA (P<0.05) was decreased. In the liver, oxidation of protein was alleviated during acute heat challenge (P<0.05), however, gene expression HSF2, 3 and 4 and HSP 70 were highly induced (P<0.05). HSP90 expression was increased by chronic thermal treatment (P<0.05). In the muscle, both types of heat stress increased protein oxidation, but HSFs and HSPs gene expression remained unaltered. Only tendencies to increase were observed in HSP 70 (P = 0.052) and 90 (P = 0.054) gene expression after acute heat stress. The differential expressions of HSF and HSP genes in different tissues of laying broiler breeder chickens suggested that anti-heat stress mechanisms might be provoked more profoundly in the heart, by which the muscle was least protected during heat stress. In addition to HSP, HSFs gene expression could be used as a marker during acute heat stress.",

A total of 160 28-day-old Cobb broiler chickens were randomly divided into four groups with four replicates per group and ten chickens per replicate. The experiment employed a 2 × 2 factorial design, consisting of two diets (basal diet or diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg ALA) and two temperature conditions (24 ± 1 ℃ or 33 ± 1 ℃). Starting from day 28, chickens were raised either under thermos neutral conditions (24 ± 1 ℃ from 18:00 to 08:00) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (33 ± 1 ℃ from 08:00 to 18:00 and 24 ± 1 ℃ from 18:00 to 08:00). Feed intake, body weight, and fecal output were recorded from day 28 onwards; with average daily feed intake and average daily weight gain were calculated. Serum biochemical parameters, antioxidant levels, and intestinal enzyme activities were measured on days 35 and 42. In comparison to thermoneutral, heat stress on day 35 decreased feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion (P < 0.01), increased full bore rate and breast muscle pH (P < 0.05/0.01), reduced digestibility (P < 0.01), and lowered lipase, trypsin levels (P < 0.01). On day 42, heat stress reduced weight gain, increased feed conversion, decreased thigh meat yield, pH, drip loss, with higher shear force (P < 0.05). ALA supplementation on day 35 increased weight gain, breast muscle P value, organic matter digestibility, lipase, and trypsin levels (P < 0.05/0.01). By day 42, ALA had no significant impact (P > 0.05), but showed interaction (P < 0.05), increasing weight gain in heat-stressed chickens (P < 0.05), reducing breast meat yield, increasing shear force, and altering thigh muscle quality (P < 0.05), with higher amylase, trypsin levels (P < 0.05/0.01).In summary, dietary supplementation of ALA improved the apparent digestibility of nutrients in heat-stressed broiler chickens by enhancing digestive enzyme activities, thereby enhancing growth performance.",

    "abstract": "Our research aimed to explore the performance, immunity, antioxidants, gene expression, and histopathology of broilers grown at standard temperatures vs those subjected to heat stress (HS) with rutin supplementation. Two hundred forty-one-day-old chicks were randomly allocated into 4 groups. Control group; Rutin group was administered rutin (500 mg/kg food) at ambient temperature; HS group, birds exposed to HS (35 ± 2°C) for 14 consecutive days; HS + Rutin group was administered the same dosage of rutin, and the birds were then exposed to HS. Molecular docking revealed high binding affinity of rutin toward the growth factors myostatin, insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGFR-1), growth hormone receptor (GHR), heat Shock protein 90 (HSP90), heat Shock factor-1(HSF-1) and HSP70. Rutin not only improved the body weight and feed conversion ratio, but it also considerably reduced the negative effects of HS on growth performance. It also led to decrease in malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and IL-6, together with an increase in the antioxidant enzymes CAT, GPX, and SOD activity in addition to a considerable improvement in immunoglobulin (IgM, IgG, and IgA) secretion during HS. Interestingly on molecular level, rutin caused an upregulation in expression of HSP90, HSF-1, HSP70, growth related genes (myostatin, IGFR-1, GHR), and downregulation of immune-related genes chemokines [Lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α factor (LITAF), IL-1β, IL-6 gene expression. These changes are further confirmed by histopathological investigation that revealed improvement in hepatic and breast muscle histoarchitecture, increased glycogen and decreased IL-1β immunoexpression after rutin supplementation in HS. In conclusion, rutin is an efficient feed additive that improves antioxidant status, growth, and immunological function in HS.",

Therefore, interest has increased in using feed additives to reduce the negative impacts of heat stress on the chickens and improve production performance. This study aimed to assess the effect of supplementing with Nigella sativa nanoparticles (Nano-NS) as an anti-stress and growth promoter in broiler diets under hot climatic conditions. A total of 375 male one-day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups (75 chicks/group). The first group fed a basal diet without additives, the second group fed a basal diet supplemented with avilamycin at 50 mg/kg, and the other groups fed a basal diet supplemented with 30, 40, and 50 mg/kg Nano-NS, respectively. Despite that feed intake was not affected, feed conversion ratio, body weight gain, and crude protein digestibility improved in broilers fed Nano-NS (P < 0.05) compared with avilamycin and the control groups. Adding Nano-NS led to an increase in the dressing percentage and the relative weight of the bursa of Fabricius and thymus. Serum high-density lipoprotein levels increased while total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) in broilers fed Nano-NS compared with control groups. Furthermore, Nano-NS supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) serum immunoglobulin (IgG and IgA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentration. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the Lactobacillus population and a decrease (P < 0.05) in the E. coli and C. perfringens population in chicks fed Nano-NS. In the intestinal tissues, mucin 2 (MUC2) gene expression increased in chickens fed 50 mg/kg Nano-NS compared to other groups. It is concluded that adding Nano-NS (up to 50 mg/kg) reduced the negative effects of heat stress via enhancing growth performance, immune responses, and antioxidant status, modulating the microbial community structure, and increasing the expression of the MUC2 gene in broilers under high ambient temperature.",

The results revealed that feed intake, body weight and feed conversion ratio (FCR), and weight of thymus, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius improved significantly (P < 0.05) in T3 compared to the other treatments. Antibody titer against Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bursal disease (IBD), and infectious bronchitis (IB) increased significantly (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3 groups. However, total leucocytes count, lymphocytes, and monocytes increased (P < 0.05) in all treated groups compared to control.

This study assessed the impact of dietary curcumin nanoparticles (CurNPs) on blood metabolites, immunity, redox status, ileal histomorphometry, and growth of broilers subjected to heat stress. A total of 400 one-day-old Ross-308 broiler chicks were randomly distributed into five groups, each consisting of eight replicates with ten birds per replicate.

Dietary CurNPs supplementation linearly (P > 0.001) improved weight gain, feed conversion ratio and European production efficiency index, while feed intake decreased linearly (P > 0.001) with increasing CurNPs supplementation. Carcass traits and serum renal and hepatic function biomarkers remained unaffected by the treatment. Serum cholesterol and LDL levels exhibited linear and quadratic (P > 0.05) reduction in all treated groups, although triglycerides and VLDL levels reduced linearly (P > 0.05) only in the 300CurNPs group.

The redox status was improved with CurNPs supplementation, as serum MDA levels showed a linear decrease (P > 0.05) in the 300CurNPs and 400CurNPs groups, while SOD levels increased linearly and quadratically (P > 0.05) across all treated groups. Furthermore, dietary CurNPs exhibited linear (P > 0.001) increases in serum levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA, though antibody titres against NDV and AIV were unaffected. In conclusion, CurNPs proved to be an effective growth promoter, enhancing growth, intestinal architecture, redox status, and humoral immunity in heat-stressed broilers.",

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "The objective was to investigate the effects of genetic type and the duration of chronic thermal stress (36 °C) on the growing efficiency, carcass traits, antioxidant status, and the expression of liver heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), growth hormone (GH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes. Two hundred and seventy one-day-old chicks (135 male chicks of each breed; Ross 308 and Cobb 500) were used in this work. On the 21st day of age, birds were allocated randomly into 3 equal groups till the 42 days of age (CON:raised in a thermoneutral condition; HS<sub>1</sub> and HS<sub>2</sub> groups were subjected to 4 and 6 h of daily thermal stress, respectively). Regardless of genetic type, thermal stress decreased the dressing percentage in broilers when compared with the thermoneutral conditions (p = 0.039). In both broiler strains, thermal stress for 6 h (HS<sub>2</sub>) increased the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.036) and the serum albumin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p = 0.023, 0.012 and 0.005, respectively) compared with the thermoneutral group. Under the thermonuteral and heat stress conditions, the Ross broiler chickens showed a significant lower serum triiodothyronine level compared with the Cobb boilers (p = 0.042). It is interesting to note that the expression of HSP70 in the liver of heat-stressed Ross broilers, either 4 or 6 h, was significantly (p = 0.002) higher than that reported in the heat-stressed Cobb broilers. In both broiler strains, the thermal stress for 6 h up-regulate the expression of SOD gene (p = 0.001), but down-regulate the expression of GH gene (p = 0.021) when compared with the CON group. In conclusion, chronic thermal stress down-regulate the mRNA expression of liver GH, concomitantly with an increase in the expression of HSP70 and SOD genes in both broiler strains. This could be useful in the identification of molecular genetic markers to assist in selecting broilers that are more tolerant to heat stress.",

    "abstract": "1. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of adding ascorbic acid or α-lipoic acid to to the diet of broilers exposed to heat stress on performance and meat quality. 2. Heat stress caused a decrease in final body weight and feed consumption, whilst ascorbic acid (AA) and α-lipoic acid (ALA) partly prevented the decrease in final body weight of males. 3. While heat stress increased the pH values of broiler drumsticks and breast meat, AA and ALA partly reduced this increase. For meat quality, AA and ALA reduced the adverse effects on the relative yellowness value, particularly on d 14 of storage. 4. It was determined that heat stress affected the microbiological quality of meat adversely, and that AA and ALA alleviated this effect to a certain extent. 5. In conclusion, while heat stress affected body weight gain and meat quality adversely, the supplementation of the ration with AA and ALA partly alleviated these adverse effects.",

    "year": "2017",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal dietary supplementations with different zinc (Zn) sources could reduce the deleterious effect of maternal heat stress on hatchability performance and progeny growth performance. A completely randomized design (n = 6) with 2 maternal environmental temperatures [normal 21 ± 1°C (NT) vs. high 32 ± 1°C (HT)] × 3 maternal dietary supplemental Zn levels [Zn-unsupplemented control diet (CON), the control diet + 110 mg of Zn/kg of diet as either inorganic ZnSO4 (iZn) or organic Zn with a moderate chelation strength (oZn)] was used. HT decreased (P < 0.05) fertility, hatchability, chick hatch weight, and embryonic survival. HT also decreased (P ≤ 0.05) progeny BW, ADG, and ADFI at one to 21, 22 to 28, and 29 to 42 d of age as well as breast muscle ratio and plasma aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase activities at 42 d of age. Maternal dietary Zn supplementation with either iZn or oZn increased (P < 0.004) Zn contents in yolk and liver, non-weak chick ratio, as well as progeny BW, ADFI, and survivability at one to 21 d of age. Notably, the addition of oZn increased (P < 0.05) hatchability and progeny thigh meat quality by reducing b* value. The progeny ADG at one to 21 d and 22 to 28 d of age and BW at 28 d of age from maternal NT were not affected (P > 0.46) by maternal dietary Zn supplementation, but the above 3 indices from HT-iZn (P < 0.05) and HT-oZn (P < 0.003) were higher than those from HT-CON. Our results indicate that maternal heat stress impairs hatching performance, embryonic development, and progeny growth performance, inducing metabolic changes, while supplementation of Zn in maternal diets regardless of Zn sources improved hatch chick quality and survivability of offspring and alleviated the negative effect of maternal heat stress on growth performance of offspring during the starter period. In addition, maternal dietary supplementation with the organic Zn improved hatchability and progeny meat quality.",

    "abstract": "1. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary glutamine (Gln) supplementation on growth performance, carcase characteristics and meat quality in broilers exposed to high ambient temperature. 2. A total of 240 35-d-old male Arbor Acres broilers were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups (three replicates of 20 birds per cage). The broilers were kept in a temperature-controlled room at either 23 degrees C (no-stress groups, NS) or 28 degrees C (heat stress groups, HS). The broilers were fed either on a basal diet (control, NS) or on the basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.5 or 1.0% Gln (HS). 3. Compared with the NS, the HS (0% Gln) group gained less weight and consumed less feed, had lower final body weight, gain-to-feed ratio, and abdominal fat yield. Breast meat in HS (0% Gln) had lower pH, water-holding capacity (WHC), a* value, ether extract (EE) content and crude protein (CP) content, and had higher shear force (SF) and L* value. 4. Linear increase were found in groups supplemented with Gln (0, 0.5% and 1.0%) for final body weight, weight gain, feed consumption, gain-to-feed ratio and abdominal fat yield. Supplementation with Gln improved breast meat pH, WHC, SF, L* value, a* value, EE content and CP content in broilers exposed to heat stress. No significant difference was observed in all the indices determined between the HS (1% Gln) and the NS. 5. Heat stress caused obvious breast meat discoloration in L*, a* and b* values. However, dietary supplementation with Gln gave a better colour stability. 6. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with Gln may alleviate heat stress-caused deterioration in growth performance, carcase characteristics, meat quality and meat colour stability of broilers.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the effects of adding methionine supplements to low-protein diets and subsequent re-feeding with a normal diet on the productive performance, slaughter parameters, leukocyte profiles and antibody response in broiler chickens reared under heat stress conditions.During the whole experimental period (6-49 days), the birds were raised in battery cages located in high ambient temperature in an open-sided housing system. A total of 360 6-day-old male chickens were divided into six treatments in six replicates with ten chicks each. Six isoenergetic diets, with similar total sulfur amino acids levels, were formulated to provide 100 and 100 (control), 85 and 100 (85S), 70 and 100 (70S), 85 and 85 (85SG), 70 and 85 (70S85G), and 70 and 70% (70SG) of National Research Council recommended levels for crude protein during the starter (6-21 day) and grower (22-42 day) periods, respectively. Subsequently, all groups received a diet containing the same nutrients during the finisher period (43-49 day). The results showed that, under heat stress conditions, average daily gain and feed conversion ratio and performance index from day 6 to 49, breast and thigh yields and antibody titer against Newcastle disease in the birds fed diets 85S, 70S and 85SG were similar to those of birds fed control diet, whereas feeding diets 70S85G and 70SG significantly decreased the values of above-mentioned parameters. Additionally, diets 85S, 70S and 85SG significantly decreased mortality rate and heterophil:lymphocyte ratio compared with the control diet. In conclusion, the results indicate that supplementation of methionine to diets 85S, 70S and 85SG, and then re-feeding with a conventional diet is an effective tool to maintain productive performance and to improve health indices and heat resistance in broilers under high ambient temperature conditions.",

    "abstract": "There is no information regarding the influence of heat stress (HS) on host metabolic profile. In this study, we investigated the effects of different environmental temperatures on oxidative status, hormone levels, HS indicators, and plasma metabolites in broilers. A total of 1,680 yellow-feather broilers (28 D old) were randomly allotted to 4 groups with 6 replicates. The broilers (29-57 D old) were maintained in thermostatic rooms (20°C, 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C) for 28 consecutive days. The results showed that the plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels and creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities gradually increased when the temperature increased from 20°C to 30°C. However, the insulin-like growth factor-І level decreased gradually. Furthermore, heat shock protein 70 expression significantly increased in the liver and breast muscle (P < 0.01). As the temperature increased, the total anti-oxidant capacity in the plasma and liver gradually decreased, whereas the malondialdehyde level increased. The activity of plasma glutathione peroxidase and total superoxide dismutase in the liver showed a similar increasing trend (P < 0.01). In addition, 15 metabolites were identified at higher (P < 0.05) levels, whereas 2 metabolites were identified at lower (P < 0.05) levels in the 30°C treatment group than those in the 25°C treatment group. Most of these potentially diagnostic biomarkers are involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, or gut microbiome-derived metabolism, indicating that HS affected the metabolic pathways in broilers. Six candidate metabolites (tartronic acid, l-bethreine, tartaric acid, allose, glutaric acid, and neohesperidin) were selected as biomarkers, as they showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing broilers under HS (P < 0.01). In conclusion, in the final stage of growth, we identified 6 plasma differential metabolites as potential biomarkers of HS-induced metabolic disorders in yellow-feathered broilers. This work offers new insights into the metabolic alterations of broilers exposed to HS and provides a new perspective for further study.",

    "abstract": "In two experiments was investigated whether feeding with an air-dry feed mixed with different amounts of water and/or supplemental ascorbic acid affect performance and carcass compositions of broilers exposed to a high ambient temperature (35 to 37 degrees C for 8 h/d and thermoneutral for 16 h/d). In the first trial, 64 one-week-old male broiler chicks were fed ad libitum in four dietary treatment groups for a 6-week period. Experimental mash diets were prepared by mixing a maize-soybean based standard broiler starter or finisher with tap water in the ratios of 0.0:1.0, 0.5:1.0, 1.0:1.0 and 1.5:1.0 (water:air-dry feed, w/w). More water in the diet increased BWG, DMI, abdominal fat and carcass weight, carcass CP, crude fat, but it deteriorated DM conversion efficiency. In the second experiment, 64 one-week-old male broiler chicks were given air-dry or wet (water:feed, 1.5:1) starter or finisher diets without or with ascorbic acid supplementation (0 and 250 mg/kg air-dry feed, resp.) ad libitum for a 6-week period. Ascorbic acid supplementation increased BWG, carcass weight and carcass CP significantly, while reducing carcass crude fat content. However, feeding broilers with a diet mixed with water in a ratio of 1.5:1.0 increased BWG, DMI, carcass weight and carcass lipid markedly, but deteriorated DM conversion efficiency. There was also a significant interaction between ascorbic acid and wet feeding, whereby ascorbic acid supplementation induced a significant reduction in carcass lipid contents of broilers fed on air-dry diets but not on wet diets. It is concluded that wet feeding, especially an addition of 150% water to produce a porridge like consistency, improved growth performance by increasing fat, ash and protein deposition in the body, while reducing DM conversion efficiency. It is also concluded that under heat stress supplemental ascorbic acid in air-dry diets stimulates broiler performance but not in wet diets.",

Four hundred and eighty male broilers were assigned to four treatments including AST0, AST20, AST40, and AST80 with 0, 20, 40, and 80 ppm astaxanthin supplementation levels, respectively. There was a linear decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) in leg muscle. Catalase and superoxide dismutase levels in the plasma were linearly increased. There was a linear increase in the level of total antioxidant capacity in the leg muscle. The 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate reducing activity of leg muscle was significantly increased in the AST80 treatment. The AST40 treatment showed an increase in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity of leg muscles. Breast meat redness and yellowness were linearly increased. The astaxanthin-supplemented treatments exhibited lower drip loss and MDA concentration of leg muscle compared with the AST0 treatment at days 3 and 9 of storage. Supplementation of 40 or 80 mg/kg astaxanthin significantly decreased heat shock protein (HSP)27, HSP70, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6 expression in the livers. The feather corticosterone was significantly lower in the astaxanthin-supplemented treatments than in the AST0 treatment. In conclusion, astaxanthin decreased the hyperthermic stress level and improved meat quality, and antioxidant status of chickens exposed to heat stress.",

Keeping this in view, the present study was designed to investigate some of the biological markers of HS in broilers as modulated by dietary supplementation of mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) and a Lactobacillus-based probiotic (LBP), either alone or in combination. Two hundred fifty 1-d-old-chicks were randomly divided into 5 groups. From d 22, the birds were either kept at the thermoneutral zone (TN) or exposed to HS to the conclusion of study, d 42. Birds were fed either a corn-based basal diet (TN and HS groups) or the same diet supplemented with 0.5% MOS (HS-MOS group), 0.1% LBP (HS-LBP group), or their combination. Birds were immunized against Newcastle disease virus on d 4 (intraocular; live attenuated) and d 20 (drinking water; live attenuated) and infectious bursal disease virus on d 8 (intraocular; live intermediate strain) and d 24 (drinking water; live attenuated). Birds were killed on d 42 to collect serum for determination of cortisol, thyroid hormones, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and postvaccinal antibody titers. Results revealed that dietary supplementations decreased (P < 0.05) the serum cortisol and cholesterol concentrations and increased (P < 0.05) thyroxine concentration compared with the HS group without affecting triiodothyronine concentration. The percentage of the C-reactive protein-positive birds was higher (P < 0.05) in the HS group compared with the TN group. Dietary supplementations improved humoral immunity against Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus during HS. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of either MOS or LBP alone or in combination can reduce some of the detrimental effects of HS in broilers.",

    "year": "2011",
    "abstract": "Exposing broilers to a high temperature increases water and electrolyte K(+) and Na(+) excretion, which negatively affects the heat dissipation capacity and acid-base homeostasis, resulting in losses in growth performance. In this experiment, the efficacy of providing oral rehydration therapy and betaine on growth performance, acid-base balance, and water and electrolyte retention was evaluated. A total of 432 one-day-old broiler chicks (Cobb) were allocated to 72 metabolic cages and reared to 31 d of age under standard conditions. From 32 to 41 d of age, chicks were exposed to heat stress (ambient temperature, 32°C) and high RH (80 to 100% RH) for 9 h daily. The ameliorative effects of a 3 × 3 factorial array of treatments administered via drinking water were evaluated in 8 replicates of 6 chicks per cage for each treatment. Two oral rehydration therapy (ORT) fluids, based on either citrate or bicarbonate salts, were added to tap water. In addition, betaine was added to tap water at an inclusion rate of 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/L to complete the array of 9 liquid-based treatments. Growth performance was assessed at 32, 35, and 41 d of age. From 32 to 35 d of age, chicks receiving ORT fluids exhibited improved growth performance, water balance, and electrolyte (K(+), Na(+)) retention. In addition, the physiological response to stress was attenuated, as indicated by lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and blood glucose concentrations relative to the negative controls. The addition of betaine at an inclusion rate of 500 mg/L improved BW gain. From d 36 to 41, treatments did not significantly influence growth performance, which suggests that chicks receiving tap water were able to compensate and adapt to the heat-stress conditions. The results demonstrate that the beneficial effects of providing ORT fluids and 500 mg of betaine/L were observed only during the first 4 d of heat exposure. After this period, adaptation to the heat appears to occur, and none of the treatments was successful in improving growth performance.",

In this study, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptomes of ileal tissues collected from probiotic-fed and control broiler chickens were analyzed to elucidate the effects of the probiotic <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> TL, as a feed additive, on the gut immune function. In total, 475 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the ileum of probiotic-fed and control birds. The expression of genes encoding pyruvate kinase, prothymosin-α, and heat stress proteins was high in the ileum of probiotic-fed birds (FPKM > 500), but not in the control group. The gene ontology functional enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the uniquely expressed genes in the control group were mostly involved in immune responses, whereas those in the probiotic group were involved in fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathways and positive regulation of cell proliferation. <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> TL downregulated the expression of certain proinflammatory factors and affected the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. Furthermore, <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> TL in broiler diets altered the expression of genes involved in immune functions in the ileum.

    "abstract": "1. The present study was conducted to examine the effects of α-lipoic acid on hypothyroidism-induced negative growth performance and whether α-lipoic acid alleviates acute heat stress in relation to hypothyroid status. 2. Female broiler chickens (14 d-old) were fed diets supplemented with α-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg) and an antithyroid substance, propylthiouracil (200 mg/kg), for 20 d under thermoneutral conditions (25°C). At 42 d of age, chickens were exposed to a high ambient temperature (36°C, 60% RH) for 4 h. 3. Under the thermoneutral condition, propylthiouracil administration decreased feed efficiency and concomitantly increased adipose tissue and thyroid gland weights. Plasma nonesterified fatty acids and triacylglycerol were also increased by propylthiouracil administration. However, α-lipoic acid supplementation did not affect the hypothyroidism-induced effects. 4. In hypothyroid chickens, the rise in respiratory rate induced by heat exposure was greatly inhibited by α-lipoic acid administration at 1 h, but this effect had disappeared at 4 h. In addition, a similar inhibitory effect on the concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids was subsequently observed at 4 h. 5. Therefore, the present study suggested that α-lipoic acid alleviates acute heat stress if chickens are in a hypothyroid status.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of night restricted feeding of extreme heat diet (EHD) containing heat stress resistance nutrients, with inverse lighting program, on their growth performance in broiler chickens exposed to extreme heat stress (33 ± 2°C). EHD 1 contained soy oil, molasses, methionine and lysine. EHD 2 contained all nutrients of EHD 1 and vitamin C additionally. Three hundred broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomized into four dietary treatment groups according to a randomized block design on the day they were hatched. The treatment groups were: T1 (EHD 1, 10:00-19:00 dark, 19:00-10:00 light), T2 (EHD 2, 10:00-19:00 dark, 19:00-10:00 light), T3 (EHD 1, 09:00-18:00 dark, 18:00-09:00 light) and T4 (EHD 2, 09:00-18:00 dark, 18:00-09:00 light). The body weight gain of the broilers increased most significantly in T2, followed by T1, T4 and T3 (p < 0.05). Weights of the immune system, thymus and bursa of Fabricius recorded higher in T1 and T2 than in T3 and T4. The spleen was higher in T1, T2 and T3 than in T4 (p < 0.05). Blood triglyceride, total cholesterol and blood sugar were higher in T1 and T2 than in T3 and T4 (p < 0.05). LDL-C recorded high in the order of T4, T3, T2 and T1, but HDL-C showed the inverse order (p < 0.05). IgG, IgA and IgM were higher in T1 and T2 than in T3 and T4, however, the corticosterone concentration showed the inverse order (p<0.05). Lactobacillus in feces was higher in T1 and T2 than in T3 and T4, but total aerobic bacteria, E. coli, Coliform bacteria was higher in T4 and T3 than in T2 and T1 (p < 0.05). Contents of acetic acid, propionic acid and total Short chain fatty acid were significantly higher in the order of T2, T1, T3 and T4. Butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid and isovaleric acid were higher in T4 and T3 than in T1 and T2 (p < 0.05).",

    "year": "2018",
    "abstract": "Heat stress poses an increasing threat for poultry production. Some amino acids have been found to play critical roles in affording thermotolerance. Recently, it was found that in ovo administration of L-leucine (L-Leu) altered amino acid metabolism and afforded thermotolerance in heat-exposed broiler chicks. In this study, two doses (35 and 70 μmol/egg) of L-Leu were administered in ovo on embryonic day 7 to determine their effect on rectal temperature (RT), body weight (BW) and thyroid hormones at hatching. Changes in RT, BW, and thermotolerance in post-hatched chicks were also analyzed. It was found that in ovo administration of L-Leu dose-dependently reduced RT and plasma thyroxine (T4) level just after hatching. In post-hatched neonatal broiler chicks, however, the higher dose of L-Leu administered in ovo significantly increased RT without affecting BW gain. In chicks that had been exposed to heat stress, the RT was significantly lowered by in ovo administration of L-Leu (high dose) in comparison with the control chicks under the same high ambient temperature (HT: 35°C±1°C, 120 min). In ovo administration of L-Leu in a high dose contributed to an increased daily body temperature and afforded thermotolerance under HT in neonatal broiler chicks.",

    "title": "Melatonin modulates tonic immobility and vigilance behavioural responses of broiler chickens to lighting regimens during the hot-dry season.",
    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Experiments were conducted with the aim of determining the influence of melatonin administration on vigilance and tonic immobility (TI) responses of Marshall broiler chickens. The broiler chickens were reared on different lighting regimens and subjected to heat stress during the hot-dry season. Simple random sampling was used to assign 300 broiler chicks into three groups, comprising 100 broiler chicks each. Group I (12D:12L cycle) was raised under natural photoperiod of 12-h light and 12-h darkness, without melatonin supplementation. Group II (CL) was kept under 24-h continuous lighting, without melatonin administration. Group III (CL+MEL) was raised under 24-h continuous lighting; with melatonin supplementation at 0.5mg/kg per os, via drinking water using a syringe. Beginning from day-old, broiler chickens in group III were individually administered with melatonin once daily for 8weeks at 17:00h. TI was induced by manual restraint, and vigilance elicited at self-righting graded for three days, two weeks apart, in 15 labeled broiler chickens from each of the three groups; at 06:00h, 13:00h and 18:00h, starting from week 4-8. Each broiler chicken was laid on its back in a U-shaped cradle, covered with cloth. Thermal microenvironment parameters of dry bulb temperature (DBT) and relative humidity (RH) were recorded at the experimental site, concurrently during the vigilance and TI tests. Inside the broiler chickens' house, the weekly temperature-humidity index (THI) was lowest at week 4 of the study, with the value of 48.60±0.08°C. At week 4, the relationship between the THI and TI induction attempts was stronger in 12D:12L cycle (r=0.589, P<0.001) than CL (r=0.264, P>0.05) or CL+MEL (r=0.096, P>0.05) broiler chickens. This indicated that the broiler chickens on 12D:12L cycle were more active compared to their melatonin-treated counterparts, apparently due to adverse effects of high DBT and high RH on the broiler chickens during the hot-dry season. The highest numbers of TI induction trial attempts were recorded at 13:00h in 12D:12L cycle and CL groups (2.13±0.34 and 2.15±0.22, respectively), when the broiler chickens were at week 8. The overall mean values of induction trial attempts differed significantly (P<0.0001) between the groups; with the lowest mean values of 1.22±0.4 recorded in CL+MEL broiler chickens. At day 42, the lowest mean TI duration of 101.87±10.24s in the CL group, recorded at 06:00h rose (P<0.001) to 184.07±23.69s at 13:00h. The overall mean duration of TI differed significantly (P<0.0001) again between the groups; with the highest mean duration of 167.82±8.35s, recorded in CL+MEL broiler chickens administered with melatonin. The overall mean vigilance behavioural ranking values of 1.85+0.07 and 1.70+0.08, obtained in 12D:12L cycle and CL broiler chickens, respectively were higher (P<0.0001) than the value of 1.44+0.05 recorded in melatonin-treated broiler chickens. The results indicated that broiler chickens belonging to both 12D:12L cycle and CL groups were more emotional, fearful or anxious, compared to CL+MEL broiler chickens. It was concluded that melatonin administration elicits boldness and confidence by suppressing freezing behaviour in broiler chickens, and it may improve their welfare and productivity.",

    "year": "2005",
    "abstract": "The effect of dietary selenium yeast, a source of organic selenium, on heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) responses, redox status, growth and feed utilization were evaluated either in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli-challenged (EPEC) or in heat-stressed (HS) male broiler chickens grown to 42 days of age. One day-old chicks in experiment 1 were challenged orally with EPEC (10(6) cfu/chicken on day 1 and boosted by water application on days 2, 3, and 4) and fed diets with or without selenium yeast. Body weight (BW), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and total mortality were determined at 42 days of age, and this was followed by collection of ileal tissue for the quantification of total glutathione (TGSH), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and hsp70 in randomly selected chickens from each treatment. In experiment 2, male broiler chickens were fed diets with or without selenium yeast under a thermoneutral rearing condition. At four weeks of age, blood and hepatic tissue were collected from chickens maintained in the thermoneutral environment and from chickens subjected to HS (40 degrees C for 1 h) and analyzed for TGSH, GSH, GSSG, and hsp70. Selenium yeast improved BW, FCR, and decreased mortality in both control and EPEC-challenged chicks. Selenium yeast significantly attenuated hsp70 expression in EPEC-challenged chickens and in those subjected to HS. The EPEC challenge increased TGSH and GSSG levels and decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. However, GSSG level accumulated in chickens fed diets without selenium supplementation resulting in a lower GSH/GSSG ratio in the selenium yeast-fed group. Heat stress increased GSSG level and decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. Selenium yeast-fed groups maintained higher levels of GSSG before and after HS with a resultant lower GSH/GSSG ratio. The hsp70 response was significantly less in those chickens fed selenium yeast and challenged with either EPEC or HS than in those chickens given no supplemental selenium. The results of this study suggest that selenium yeast supplementation had imparted resistance to oxidative stress associated with enteric bacteria infection and to high temperature exposure. It is believed that the resistance to the stressors was due to an improved redox status of the selenium yeast-fed chickens.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress (HS) has become a major concern for the poultry industry in many countries. HS impacts gut health by causing damaged mucosal microstructures, increased oxidative stress, weakened immunity, and heightened permeability to toxins and poultry pathogens. We investigated the potential benefits to broiler chickens subjected to HS of dietary supplementation with Bacillus subtilis 14823. Growth performance, gut barrier integrity, and expressions of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with B. subtilis spores at concentrations of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g of feed (BS6 group) and 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/g of feed (BS7 group) improved body weight and body weight gain during d 0-42 (P < 0.05), while the feed intake of the BS7 group was highest (P < 0.05). Additionally, the BS6 group showed a better feed conversion ratio than the control (CON) group (P < 0.05). The BS7 group showed the lowest serum fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran levels (P < 0.05), and both the BS6 and BS7 groups showed lower corticosterone levels than the CON group (P < 0.05). Additionally, both the BS6 and BS7 groups demonstrated increased villi height and villus height/crypt depth ratio, along with decreased crypt depth in the duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05). However, only the BS7 group exhibited greater improvements than the CON group in the jejunum at d 35. Furthermore, at d 14 and 35, mRNA expressions of occludin, claudin-1, and tight junction protein-1 in the jejunum were upregulated (P < 0.05), and expression levels of five inflammatory cytokine genes were downregulated in the ileum (P < 0.05). Our findings provide new insights and evidence supporting the application of B. subtilis 14823 for enhancing growth performance, gut barrier integrity, and modulating inflammatory cytokines in broilers.",

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "1. This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of ginger (Zingiber officinale) feed supplementation on growth performance, antioxidant status, carcass characteristics and blood parameters in broiler chicks under conditions of heat stress (32 ± 2ºC for 8 h per d). 2. A total of 336 d-old male broiler chicks (Cobb-500) were randomly assigned to one of 6 dietary groups representing: basal diet with no supplement as control, basal diet containing 100 mg/kg vitamin E as positive control, basal diets containing either 7.5 or 15 g/kg of ginger root powder, and diets containing 75 or 150 mg/kg of ginger essential oil. 3. The results indicated that at 22 d of age, the group receiving 7.5 g/kg of ginger root powder experienced significantly increased body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) compared to the control group. There were no significant difference among the diet groups regarding BW, BWG, feed intake (FI) or feed conversion ratio (FCR) at 42 and 49 d of age. 4. The inclusion of powder and essential oil of ginger in broiler diets did not affect carcass characteristics and blood parameters of the chickens. However, in the group receiving 150 mg/kg ginger essential oil, the total superoxide dismutase (TSOD) activity in liver increased compared to the control group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in liver also decreased in the groups receiving ginger powder and essential oil compared to that in the control group. There were no significant difference between experimental groups regarding glutathione peroxidise (Gpx), TSOD and catalase (CAT) enzymes in red blood cells. All dietary groups increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and decreased MDA concentration in serum compared to the control group. 5. The results of this study suggest that ginger powder and essential oils may be a suitable replacement for synthetic antioxidants in broiler diets. Results also suggest that ginger powder might be better than extracted essential oil for improving antioxidant status in broilers.",

    "year": "1997",
    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the effects of supplemental ascorbic acid (AA) on the energy conversion of broiler chicks maintained at thermoneutral and potential heat stress temperatures using indirect convective calorimetry; and 2) to determine whether changes in energy conversion are reflected in changes in lipid metabolism. In Experiment 1, 120 2-d-old cockerels, housed in two identical environmental chambers, were maintained under constant light (2.0 +/- 0.2 fc) and recommended thermal conditions (29.6 +/- 0.8 C; 33.4 +/- 8.0% RH) and consumed water and feed ad libitum. Beginning on Day 8 posthatch, one-half of the birds inside each chamber were randomly assigned and received feed supplemented with AA. Beginning on Day 9 posthatch, the temperature inside one chamber was increased to 34 C whereas the other chamber remained thermoneutral. This design resulted in four treatments: 1) thermoneutral (TN: 27.7 +/- 0.8 C; 40.9 +/- 9.4% RH) and 0 mg AA/kg feed (ppm); 2) TN and 150 ppm AA; 3) heat stress (H: 33.8 +/- 0.5 C; 43.3 +/- 7.4% RH) and 0 ppm AA; or 4) H and 150 ppm AA. Also beginning on Day 9 posthatch, birds were randomly assigned to one of three identical, indirect convective calorimeters designed to accommodate TN or H. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, respiratory quotient, and heat production were evaluated daily for 8 h, through Day 17 posthatch. Following calorimetric measurement, birds were returned to their respective caging unit/chamber for the remainder of the study. Weight gain, feed intake, and gain: feed were also measured over the 9-d study. Heat exposure depressed (P < 0.05) weight gain, feed intake, and gain:feed. Ascorbic acid increased (P < 0.10) weight gain. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide and heat production per kilogram0.75 decreased (P < 0.05) with age with no change in the respiratory quotient. Heat exposure lowered (P < 0.001) the respiratory quotient. A temperature by AA interaction was detected in which heat-exposed birds expressed lower (P < 0.10) respiratory quotients when consuming the AA-supplemented diet. In Experiment 2, 18 2-d-old cockerels, housed in an environmental chamber, were maintained under constant light and recommended thermal conditions (29.3 +/- 0.4 C; 41.4 +/- 3.3% RH) and consumed water and feed ad libitum. On Day 9 posthatch, birds were deprived of feed for 24 h with ad libitum access to water supplemented with either 0 or 400 mg AA/L. Blood samples were obtained from each bird before and after feed withdrawal and supplementation. Supplemented birds exhibited elevated (P < 0.01) plasma AA, levels that were not affected by feed deprivation. Feed deprivation increased (P < 0.0001) plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate with no effect of AA, and decreased (P < 0.05) plasma triglycerides in the unsupplemented birds. A feed withdrawal by AA interaction was detected in which plasma triglycerides remained elevated in birds supplemented with AA. These data suggest that supplemental AA influences body energy stores that are used for energy purposes during periods of reduced energy intake.",

    "abstract": "An experiment was designed to investigate the effect of Arg, Lys, Met, and environmental temperature on broiler performance and associated changes in duodenal and pancreatic polyamines. Two groups of 26-d-old Ross male broilers raised under thermoneutral (TN) conditions were reallocated to 4 rooms kept at heat stress (HS) or TN. Birds were fed equimolar amounts of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMB) or DL-Met (DLM) at requirement levels with Arg:Lys at 0.95 or 1.40. Twelve replicates of 4 birds were offered each diet ad libitum. Body weight gain, efficiency of dietary CP accretion (CPE), feed intake, and feed conversion ratio were ascertained from 26 to 33 d and from 34 to 47 d of age. One bird per cage was killed at 33 and 47 d, and samples of duodenum and pancreas were assayed for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (Spm), together with estimates of duodenal villus height. From 26 to 33 d, birds fed HMB performed better than those fed DLM, but only at TN conditions. From 34 to 47 d, feeding HMB tended to optimize CPE when added to diets high in Arg. However, lower CPE was obtained when HMB was added to low-Arg diets, whereas birds fed DLM were unaffected by these treatments (P < 0.10). Methionine source, Arg:Lys, or both affected the concentrations of duodenal and pancreatic polyamines, with some changes correlating with performance variables during HS (P > 0.05). It was found that HS caused lower tissue spermidine (P < 0.001) and higher pancreatic Spm (P = 0.08) from 34 to 47 d. Putrescine concentrations were affected by diet and HS, depending on tissue and experimental period. Pancreatic Spm correlated negatively with changes in CPE influenced by Arg:Lys by Met source interaction in chronically heat-stressed birds. The possible association between polyamine metabolism and some of the effects of the Arg:Lys by Met source interaction observed in chronically stressed birds deserves further investigation.",

    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "Selenium is an essential trace element that up-regulates a major component of the antioxidant defense mechanism by controlling the body's glutathione (GSH) pool and its major Se-containing antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Evidence has emerged suggesting that organic selenium, natural seleno-amino acids found in plants, grains and selenized yeast, maintains the antioxidant defense system more efficiently than inorganic selenium. Inorganic selenium is a pro-oxidant, whereas organic selenium possesses antioxidant properties itself. As a pro-oxidant, inorganic selenium is not suitable for animals or humans. Therefore, we examined the GSH-GPX system in broiler chickens and determined that organic selenium was indeed more beneficial than inorganic selenium. Chickens fed the organic selenium as Sel-Plex, a selenized yeast, had elevated GPX activity in both blood and liver in a thermoneutral environment and after heat distress. More importantly, the ability to reduce the oxidized glutathione (GSSG to 2 GSH) was enhanced and facilitated by maintenance of glutathione reductase activity. Organic selenium-fed chickens were less affected by mild heat distress than inorganic selenium-fed chickens, and this assessment was based upon less induction of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) in organic selenium-fed chickens. Our results clearly show that heat distress, a potent inducer of oxidative stress and hsp70, can be partially ameliorated by feeding organic selenium. We attribute this observation to an enhanced GSH-GPX antioxidant system in organic selenium-fed chickens.",

    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Divergent selection of broilers for water conversion ratio has established and high-(HWE) and low- water efficient (LWE) broiler lines. Two 2 × 2 factorial experiments were conducted to assess the gene expression profile of systems involved in renal water homeostasis. In Exp. 1, male and female HWE and LWE broilers were individually phenotyped between 4 and 6 wks of age to determine growth performance and water conversion ratio (g water intake/g body weight gain). Kidney samples were obtained from 5 males and 5 females from each line. In Exp. 2, HWE and modern random bred (MRB) broilers were placed in 12 controlled-environmental chambers (2 floor pens/chamber, 6 chambers/line, 11 birds per pen, 132 birds/line) on day of hatch. The broilers were brooded at thermoneutral temperatures from 0 to 4 wks. From 4 to 7 wks, broilers were maintained at thermoneutral (TN, 25 °C) or exposed to cyclic heat stress (HS, 35 °C, 8h/day) conditions. Body weight, feed intake, and water intake were recorded. Kidney samples were collected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80 °C for gene expression analysis. Data were analyzed by Two-way ANOVA and means compared by Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test. Molecular analyses from Exp. 1 showed that the renal expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP), angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II receptor type 1 and 2 (AT1/2), sodium-potassium ATPase subunit B1 (ATP1B1), and aquaporin 3 (AQP3) were upregulated in HWE compared to the LWE line. In contrast, mRNA expression of mesotocin receptor (MTR), AT1/2, AQP1/2, and occludin were significantly higher in females than in males. In Exp. 2, target genes were regulated in environment and/or line-dependent manner. The renal expression of heat shock proteins 70 and 90, AVP receptor 2 (AVPR2), AGT, renin, AT1/2, and AQP1was significantly upregulated in HS compared to TN birds, however AVPR2 expression was significantly higher in HWE compared to MRB birds. Together, the up-regulation of AVP, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and AQP in HWE, female, or under HS conditions suggests a better renal water reabsorption to support water use efficiency.",

    "abstract": "1. Hubbard x Hubbard (HH) and Shaver x Shaver (SS) chicks given a dietary supplement of either 50 mg/kg oxytetracycline (OTC) or 1 g/kg Lactobacillus culture (LC) were exposed to 36 +/- 1 degrees C for 3 h daily from day (d) 21 to 42. 2. Prior to heat treatment, body weight (d 21) and weight gain (d 1 to d 21) of OTC and LC birds were greater than those fed the control diet. Chicks given LC had the best food efficiency followed by OTC and control birds during d 1 to d 21. Body weight (d 1 and d 21) and weight gain (d 1 to d 21) were greater for HH tlhan SS chicks. 3. After 3 weeks of heat exposure, birds receiving the LC diet had greater body weight and weight gain, higher food intake and lower food efficiency than OTC and control chicks. 4. Antibody production against Newcastle discase vaccine on d 21 was not affected by strain or diet. On d 42, while diet had negligible effect on this variable among the SS broilers, HH birds fed LC had higher antibody production than those on the control diet. 5. Neither strain nor diet had a significant effect on mortality.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress hampers egg production and lowers fertility in layers. This study investigated global protein abundance in the small yellow follicles (SYFs, 6-8 mm diameter) of a broiler-type strain of Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) under acute heat stress. Twelve 30-week-old TCC hens were allocated to a control group maintained at 25°C, and to three acute heat-stressed groups subjected to 38°C for 2 h without recovery, with 2-h recovery, or with 6-h recovery. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis analysis identified 119 significantly differentially expressed proteins after acute heat exposure. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of these proteins are involved in molecular binding (34%), catalytic activity (23%), and structural molecule activity (11%), and participate in metabolic processes (20%), cellular processes (20%), and cellular component organization or biogenesis (11%). Proteins associated with stress response and survival (HSP25, HSP47, HSP70, HSC70, HSPA9), cytoskeleton remodeling, mitochondrial metabolic process of ATP production, antioxidative defense (peroxiredoxin-6), cargo lipid export and delivery (vitellogenin, apolipoprotein B and A1), and toxin/metabolite clearance and delivery (albumin) were upregulated after acute heat stress in the SYFs of TCCs. No overt cell death and atresia were observed in SYFs after acute heat stress. Collectively, these responses may represent a protective mechanism to maintain follicle cell integrity and survival, thereby ensuring a sufficient pool of SYFs for selection into the ovulation hierarchy for successful egg production.",

    "year": "2025",
    "abstract": "Chickens are one of the most economically and nutritionally important livestock species globally, yet they are highly vulnerable to environmental stressors which compromise their growth and physiological stability. In this study we investigated the effect of wind speed on growth performance, physiological responses, blood profiles, and transcriptomic adaptations in Ross-308 broilers under high-temperature conditions. A total of 240 broilers were divided into three groups: low wind, high temperature (LWH; 33°C, 60% RH, 0 m/s), medium wind, high temperature (MWH; 33°C, 60% RH, 1 m/s), and high wind, high temperature (HWH; 33°C, 60% RH, 2 m/s). The results showed that broilers in the HWH and MWH groups had significantly higher feed intake, body weight gain, and improved thermoregulation, as indicated by lower rectal temperatures and respiration rates compared to the LWH group. Additionally, serum potassium and phosphorus levels were higher in the HWH and MWH groups, indicating enhanced metabolic stability under heat stress. Transcriptomic analysis identified differentially expressed genes associated with the heat stress response, such as HSPB9, THBS1, TLR2, EHHADH, and PDK4. Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways related to vital processes, innate immune responses, and biosynthetic pathways, which contribute to thermal resilience. Upregulated genes like PDK4 and heat shock proteins were associated with improved energy efficiency and stress response, whereas downregulated genes in LWH indicated compromised growth. This study underscores the vital role of wind speed in ameliorating heat stress effects in broilers, laying the groundwork for enhanced environmental management and potential genetic and nutritional strategies in poultry production.",

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of phase feeding (PF) on broilers subjected to heat stress during the grower and finisher periods. Birds were fed diets containing lysine, sulfur amino acid (SAA), or threonine levels based on NRC (1994) recommendations or predictions from linear regression equations (PF). With PF, diets were switched every other day, resulting in steadily decreasing lysine, SAA, and threonine levels. In Experiment 1 (42 to 56 d), growth performance was unaffected (P > 0.05) by diet, and cost per kilogram of weight gain did not differ (P > 0.05) between treatments. In Experiments 2 (23 to 42 d) and 3 (42 to 63 d) birds were housed in environmental chambers and subjected to high (15 h at 35 C, 9 h at 23.9 C) or normal (23.9 C) temperatures. In both experiments, heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) growth performance and increased (P < 0.05) percentage leg yield. Moreover, heat stress decreased percentage breast yield (P < 0.05) in Experiment 2. Growth performance and carcass yield were unaffected (P > 0.05) by PF relative to birds fed NRC-based diets, with the exception of feed efficiency, which was reduced (P < 0.05) by PF under normal temperatures in Experiment 2. Data indicated that dietary lysine, SAA, and threonine levels may be reduced every other day under a PF program without adversely affecting growth performance or carcass yield of birds exposed to high environmental temperatures. Cost analysis indicated that savings might be available with PF under high temperature conditions.",

    "year": "2014",
    "abstract": "Experiments were performed with the aim of determining the effect of melatonin administration on diurnal fluctuations in cloacal temperature (CT) of Marshall broiler chickens during the hot dry season. Birds in group I (12L:12D cycle) were raised under natural photoperiod of 12-h light and 12-h darkness, without melatonin supplementation, while those in group II (LL) were kept under 24-h continuous lighting, without melatonin administration. Broiler chickens in group III (LL + melatonin) were raised under 24-h continuous lighting, with melatonin supplementation at 0.5 mg/kg per os. The cloacal temperatures of 15 labeled broiler chickens from each group were measured at 6:00, 13:00, and 19:00 h, 7 days apart, from days 14-42. Temperature-humidity index was highest at day 14 of the study, with the value of 36.72 ± 0.82 °C but lowest at day 28 with the value of 30.91 ± 0.80 °C (P < 0.0001). The overall mean hourly cloacal temperature value of 41.51 ± 0.03 °C obtained in the 12L:12D cycle birds was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the value of 41.16 ± 0.03 °C recorded in the melatonin-treated group but lower than that of 41.65 ± 0.03 °C obtained in the LL birds. Mortality due to hyperthermia commenced at day 28 in both 12L:12D cycle and LL broiler chickens but was delayed till day 42 in LL + MEL broiler chickens. In conclusion, melatonin administration alleviated the deleterious effects of heat stress on broiler chickens by maintaining their cloacal temperature at relatively low values.",

    "year": "2012",
    "abstract": "Extreme thermal conditions may dramatically affect the performance of broilers and other domestic animals, thereby impairing animal welfare and causing economic losses. Although body core temperature is the parameter that best reflects a bird's thermal status, practical and physiological obstacles make it irrelevant as a source of information on the thermal status of commercial flocks. Advances in the technology of infrared thermal imaging have enabled highly accurate, noncontact, and noninvasive measurements of skin surface temperature. Providing that skin surface temperature correlates with body temperature, this technology could enable acquisition of reliable information on the thermal status of animals, thereby improving diagnoses of environmental stress in a flock. This study of broiler chickens found a strong positive correlation between body core temperature and facial surface temperature, as recorded by infrared thermal imaging. The correlation was equally strong at all ages from 8 to 36 d during exposure to acute heat stress with or without proper ventilation and after acclimation to chronic heat exposure. A similar correlation was found by measurements in commercial flocks of broilers. Measurements of blood plasma concentrations of corticosterone, thyroid hormones, and arginine vasotocin confirmed that metabolic activity was low after acclimation to chronic exposure to heat, whereas ventilation was at least as efficient as acclimation in reducing thermal stress but did not impair metabolism. In light of these novel results, commercial benefits of infrared thermal imaging technology are suggested, especially in climate control for commercial poultry flocks. The application of this technique to other domestic animals should be investigated in future experiments.",

    "year": "2003",
    "abstract": "Experimentation was conducted to estimate dietary lysine needed to optimize production of summer-reared broilers between 42 to 56 d of age. Male Ross x Ross 308 chicks were placed in floor pens of an open-sided house and provided common feeds from placement to 42 d of age. During the subsequent 42 to 56 d, birds received a corn-soybean meal basal diet (18% CP and 3,250 kcal/kg ME) established to provide limiting essential amino acids favorably balanced near requirement levels with the exception of lysine. Four 0.10% increments of L-lysine isonitrogenously displaced L-glutamic acid from the basal diet to provide analyzed values progressing from 0.85 to 1.25%. Body weight gain and mortality were not altered as dietary lysine increased; however, feed conversion linearly improved. Chilled carcass yield, amount of abdominal fat, and recovery of skinless boneless breast meats were not affected. Measurements on nitrogen balance and plasma levels of total protein, albumin, glucose, and uric acid taken at 49 d from a concurrent study using sample birds in raised-wire cages and identical feeds also failed to define a requirement. However, plasma aspartic transferase increased to a maximum approximating 1.05% lysine, whereas free lysine concentration linearly increased to the highest level. Overall data supported a lysine requirement no less than 0.95% that was greater than the previous minimum of 0.85% obtained under similar terms without heat stress. Suppression of growth from heat stress appears to reduce the absolute need for lysine; however, increased dietary concentration appears necessary to accommodate depressed feed intake and improve its effectiveness.",

(EA) supplementation on growth performance and liver oxidative injury of broilers reared under heat stress, a total of 320 22-day-old male broilers were randomly allotted into five groups with eight replicates of eight birds each. Broilers in the control group were housed at 22 ± 1 °C and fed the basal diet. Broilers in the HS, HS-EA1, HS-EA2, and HS-EA3 groups were fed basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 g/kg EA, respectively, and reared under cyclic high temperature (34 ± 1 °C for 8 h/day and 22 ± 1 °C for 16 h/day). Broilers fed EA diets had higher final body weight, average daily body weight gain, and average daily feed intake, as well as liver concentration of reduced glutathione, activities of antioxidant enzymes, abilities to inhibit hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical (HS-EA2 and HS-EA3), and lower liver concentrations of reactive oxygen metabolites, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl (HS-EA1, HS-EA2, and HS-EA3) than HS group (P < 0.05). EA treatment downregulated the mRNA levels of heat shock proteins 70 and 90, upregulated the mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (HS-EA1, HS-EA2, and HS-EA3) and heme oxygenase 1 (HS-EA2 and HS-EA3) in liver of heat-treated broilers (P < 0.05). In conclusion, EA alleviated heat stress-induced growth depression and liver oxidative injury in broilers, possibly through improving the antioxidant capacity and regulating the pertinent mRNA expression. The appropriate inclusion level of EA in broiler diet is 1.00-1.25 g/kg.",

    "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to determine whether ascorbic acid (AA) increases resistance of female Hubbard x Hubbard broiler chicks to multiple concurrent stressors. Stressors imposed from 10 to 17 d posthatch included 2 x 2 x 2 factorial combinations of beak trimming [(B), sham-operated or beak-trimmed and cauterized], coccidiosis [(C), gavage with 0 or 3 x 10(5) sporulated Eimeria tenella oocysts], and heat stress [(H), 28 vs 33 C]. A starter diet was supplemented with AA to provide 0, 150, or 300 ppm (milligrams per kilogram). This resulted in a 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 factorial design with two six-chick replicates of each of the 24 treatment combinations. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and a level of 95% significance. Ascorbic acid increased feed intake and lowered plasma corticosterone and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. Heat depressed weight gain and feed intake and elevated heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. Heat and AA interacted to improve weight gain and feed intake and lower heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. Coccidiosis depressed weight gain, feed efficiency, and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. Coccidiosis and AA interacted to increase feed intake and lower plasma corticosterone and heterophil: lymphocyte ratios. Beak trimming increase heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. Beak trimming and AA interacted to increase feed intake and lower heterophil: lymphocyte ratios. Weight gain and feed efficiency decreased whereas heterophil:lymphocyte ratios increased linearly in unsupplemented birds as a function of stressor \"order\" (the number of stressors imposed simultaneously) indicating an additive effect of systematically increasing the number of stressors. No changes in feed efficiency or heterophil:lymphocyte ratios were detected as a function of stressor order when AA was provided. Ascorbic acid reduced the slope of the regression equation describing the relationship between weight gain and stressor order. It was concluded that AA, particularly at 150 ppm, enhanced performance of broiler chicks exposed to multiple concurrent environmental stressors.",
